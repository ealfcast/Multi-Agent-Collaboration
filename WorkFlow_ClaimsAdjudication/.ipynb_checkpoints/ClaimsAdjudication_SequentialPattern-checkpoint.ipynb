    "## Understanding Multi-Agent Systems and Swarm Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "An agent swarm is a collection of autonomous AI agents working together to solve complex problems through collaboration. Inspired by natural systems like ant colonies or bird flocks, agent swarms leverage collective intelligence where the combined output exceeds what any single agent could produce. By distributing tasks and sharing information, swarms can tackle complex problems more efficiently and effectively than individual agents working in isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-agent systems consist of multiple interacting intelligent agents within an environment. These systems enable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Distributed Problem Solving*: Breaking complex tasks into subtasks for parallel processing\n",
    "- *Information Sharing*: Agents exchange insights to build collective knowledge\n",
    "- *Specialization*: Different agents focus on specific aspects of a problem\n",
    "- *Redundancy*: Multiple agents working on similar tasks improve reliability\n",
    "- *Emergent Intelligence*: The system exhibits capabilities beyond those of its individual components\n",
    "\n",
    "Swarm intelligence emphasizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Decentralized Control*: No single agent directs the entire system\n",
    "2. *Local Interactions*: Agents primarily interact with nearby agents\n",
    "3. *Simple Rules*: Individual agents follow relatively simple behaviors\n",
