    "### Brief Overview of Multi-Agent Systems\n",
    "Multi-agent systems consist of multiple autonomous agents collaborating to solve complex problems through task distribution, specialization, and parallel processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a multi-agent system like a group of peers collaborating on a project. Each member of the team has an assigned role to help distribute the work of the project, and that work is usually catered to the expertise of that team member. Similarly, in a multi-agent system, each agent is a subject matter expert of some topic and is given relevant tools and resources. When given a project, a coordinator agent can split the work among the group of subject-matter expert agents to distribute and reduce the complexity of each unit of work. Once completed, the work of each agent can be combined through a coordinator agent to complete the project.\n",

    "Phoenix SDK provides built-in support for creating these systems through the agent_graph tool, allowing developers to move beyond single-agent limitations.\n",
