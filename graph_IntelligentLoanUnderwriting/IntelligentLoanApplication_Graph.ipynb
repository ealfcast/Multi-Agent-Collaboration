    "### Brief Overview of Multi-Agent Systems\n",
    "Multi-agent systems consist of multiple autonomous agents collaborating to solve complex problems through task distribution, specialization, and parallel processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a multi-agent system like a group of peers collaborating on a project. Each member of the team has an assigned role to help distribute the work of the project, and that work is usually catered to the expertise of that team member. Similarly, in a multi-agent system, each agent is a subject matter expert of some topic and is given relevant tools and resources. When given a project, a coordinator agent can split the work among the group of subject-matter expert agents to distribute and reduce the complexity of each unit of work. Once completed, the work of each agent can be combined through a coordinator agent to complete the project.\n",

      "## Identity Discrepancies\n",
      "- **SSN Inconsistencies**: The documents contain different SSN numbers (XXX-XX-7845, XXX-XX-1234, XXX-XX-4829), which is a significant red flag for potential synthetic identity fraud.\n",
      "- **Name Format Variations**: \"Joe Doe\" vs \"Joseph 'Joe' Doe\" across different documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Address Inconsistencies\n",
      "- Different addresses appear across documents:\n",
      "  - 2834 Maple Avenue, Portland, OR (Credit Report)\n",
      "  - 123 Maple Street, Springfield, IL (Loan Application)\n",
      "  - 1247 Maple Grove Lane, Springfield, IL (Property Appraisal)\n",
      "  - 123 Testing Boulevard, Demo City (ID Document)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Employment/Income Verification Issues\n",
      "- **Income Discrepancy**: \n",
      "  - Loan application states $102,000 annual income\n",
      "  - Paystub shows $101,520 YTD\n",
      "  - Tax return shows only $75,750 total income\n",
      "- **Employer Name Mismatch**: \"TechCorp Solutions Inc.\" vs \"Ocktank\" on different documents\n",
      "\n",
      "## Document Authenticity Concerns\n",
      "- The ID appears to be a fake \"Republic of Testlandia\" document marked as testing material\n",
      "- Several documents contain explicit \"testing\" or \"sample\" markers\n",
      "\n",
      "## Credit History Red Flags\n",
      "- Multiple late payments in credit history (30-60 days)\n",
      "- Recent credit inquiries in last 12 months\n",
      "- High revolving credit utilization (29%)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Application Specifics\n",
      "- **Loan Request Inconsistency**: \n",
      "  - Loan application requests $420,000 for property worth $525,000\n",
      "  - Property appraisal shows $304,000 loan amount for property worth $385,000\n",
      "  - These are completely different properties with different valuations\n",
      "\n",
      "## Bank Statement Analysis\n",
      "- Multiple bank accounts with different institutions showing similar transaction patterns\n",
      "- Consistent \"ACME Corp\" direct deposits on paystubs vs \"ABC Corp\" on bank statements\n",
      "\n",
      "## Quantitative Risk Assessment\n",
      "- **Probability of Default (PD)**: Medium-High (credit score 705 with delinquency history)\n",
      "- **Loss Given Default (LGD)**: Elevated due to potential identity fraud and property valuation inconsistencies\n",
      "- **Overall Risk Score**: High (8/10) due to multiple identity and documentation inconsistencies\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommended Actions\n",
      "1. Request identity verification through multiple channels\n",
      "2. Obtain IRS tax transcripts directly (not applicant-provided tax forms)\n",
      "3. Request employment verification directly from employer\n",
      "4. Cross-verify property ownership records\n",
      "5. Flag application for enhanced due diligence\n",
      "6. Consider rejecting application due to multiple inconsistencies suggesting intentional misrepresentation\n",
