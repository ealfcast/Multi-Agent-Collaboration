If the trailer is not shown on the declarations page, the limit of liability is $500.     2. Payments for loss to a covered auto, non-owned auto, or custom parts or equipment are subject to the following provisions: a. If coverage applies to a non-owned auto, we will provide the broadest     coverage applicable to any covered auto shown on the declarations page.     b. If you have elected a Stated Amount for a covered auto, the Stated Amount is the most we will pay for all loss to that covered auto, includ- ing its custom parts or equipment.     c. Coverage for custom parts or equipment will not cause our limit of li- ability for loss to an auto under this Part IV to be increased to an amount in excess of the actual cash value of the auto, including its custom parts or equipment.     d. In determining the amount necessary to repair damaged property to its pre-loss condition, the amount to be paid by us: (i) will not exceed the prevailing competitive labor rates charged in the     area where the property is to be repaired and the cost of repair or replacement parts and equipment, as reasonably determined by us; and     (ii) will be based on the cost of repair or replacement parts and equip- ment which may be new, reconditioned, remanufactured or used, including, but not limited to: (a) original manufacturer parts or equipment; and (b) nonoriginal manufacturer parts or equipment.     e. To determine the amount necessary to repair or replace the damaged property as referred to in subsection 1., the total cost of necessary re- pair or replacement may be reduced by unrepaired prior damage . Un- repaired prior damage includes broken, cracked or missing parts; rust; dents; scrapes; gouges; and peeling paint. The reduction for unrepaired prior damage is the cost of labor, parts and materials necessary to repair or replace damage, deterioration, defects, or wear and tear on exterior body parts, windshields and other glass, wheels, and paint, that existed prior to the accident and that is eliminated as a result of the repair or replacement of property damaged in the loss.21     f. To determine the amount necessary to repair or replace the damaged property as referred to in subsection 1., an adjustment may be made for betterment or depreciation and physical condition on: (i) batteries; (ii) tires; (iii) engines and transmissions, if the engine has greater than 80,000     miles; and (iv) any other mechanical parts that are nonfunctioning or inoperative . We will not make an adjustment for the labor costs associated with the replacement or repair of these parts.     g. The actual cash value is determined by the market value, age, and con- dition of the vehicle at the time the loss occurs.     3. No deductible will apply to a loss to window glass when the glass is repaired instead of replaced.     4. Duplicate recovery for the same elements of damages is not permitted. 5. The following additional limits of liability apply to Pet Injury coverage:     a. The most we will pay for all damages in any one loss is a total of $1,000 regardless of the number of dogs or cats involved.     b. If your pet dies in, or as a direct result of, a covered loss, we will provide a death benefit of $1,000, less any payment we made toward veterinary expenses for your pet.     c. No deductible shall apply to this coverage.     PAYMENT OF LOSS     We may, at our option: 1. pay for the loss in money; or 2. repair or replace the damaged or stolen property.     At our expense, we may return any recovered stolen property to you or to the address shown on the declarations page, with payment for any damage result- ing from the theft. We may keep all or part of the property at the agreed or ap- praised value.     We may settle any loss with you or the owner or lienholder of the property.     NO BENEFIT TO BAILEE     Coverage under this Part IV will not directly or indirectly benefit any carrier or other bailee for hire.     LOSS PAYABLE CLAUSE     Payment under this Part IV for a loss to a covered auto will be made according to your interest and the interest of any lienholder shown on the declarations page or designated by you . At our option, payment may be made to both jointly,22     or to either separately . However, if the covered auto is not a total loss, we may make payment to you and the repairer of the auto.     The lienholder\\u2019s interest will not be protected: 1. where fraud, misrepresentation, material omission, or intentional damage     resulting in a denial of coverage by us has been committed by or at the direc- tion of you or any person seeking coverage; or     2. where the loss is otherwise not covered under the terms of this policy . If this policy is cancelled, nonrenewed or voided, the interest of any lienholder under this agreement will also terminate.     OTHER SOURCES OF RECOVERY     If other sources of recovery also cover the loss, we will pay only our share of the loss . Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits . However, any insurance we provide for a non-owned auto, or trailer not shown on the declarations page, will be excess over any other col- lectible source of recovery including, but not limited to: 1. any coverage provided by the owner of the non-owned auto or trailer; 2. any other applicable physical damage insurance; and 3. any other source of recovery applicable to the loss.\\\\n\\\\nMetadata: {'x-amz-bedrock-kb-source-uri': 's3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-document-page-number': 24.0, 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-chunk-id': '1%3A0%3ADeCPhJoB8T_-1QJqBSkV', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-data-source-id': '8L7KL1MIT4'}\\\\n\\\\nScore: 0.4309\\\\nDocument ID: s3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf\\\\nContent: INSURING AGREEMENT\\u2014RENTAL REIMBURSEMENT COVERAGE     We will reimburse rental charges incurred when you rent an auto from a rental agency or auto repair shop due to a loss to a covered auto for which Rental Re- imbursement Coverage has been purchased.

Additional fees or charges for insurance, damage waivers, optional equipment, fuel, or accessories are not covered.     This coverage is limited to the each day limit shown on the declarations page for a maximum of 30 days.

INSURING AGREEMENT\\u2014LOAN/LEASE PAYOFF COVERAGE     If you pay the premium for this coverage, and the covered auto for which this coverage was purchased is deemed by us to be a total loss, we will pay, in addi- tion to any amounts otherwise payable under this Part IV, the difference between: 1. the actual cash value of the covered auto at the time of the total loss; and 2. any greater amount the owner of the covered auto is legally obligated to     pay under a written loan or lease agreement to which the covered auto is subject at the time of the total loss, reduced by: a. unpaid finance charges or refunds due to the owner for such charges; b. excess mileage charges or charges for wear and tear; c. charges for extended warranties or refunds due to the owner for extend-     ed warranties; d. charges for credit insurance or refunds due to the owner for credit insur-     ance; e. past due payments and charges for past due payments; and f. collection or repossession expenses.     However, our payment under this coverage shall not exceed the limit of liability shown on the declarations page . The limit of liability is a percentage of the ac- tual cash value of the covered auto at the time of the loss.     This coverage applies only if you have purchased both Comprehensive Cover- age and Collision Coverage for that covered auto and the loss is covered under one of those coverages.     INSURING AGREEMENT\\u2014PET INJURY COVERAGE     If you have purchased Collision coverage for at least one covered auto under your policy, and if your pet sustains injury or death while inside a covered auto or non-owned auto at the time of a loss covered under Collision or Comprehen- sive coverage, we will provide: 1. up to $1,000 for reasonable and customary veterinary fees incurred by you,     a relative, or a rated resident if your pet is injured in, or as a direct result of, the covered loss; or     2. a $1,000 death benefit if your pet dies in, or as a direct result of, the covered loss, less any payment we made toward veterinary expenses for your pet .     In the event of a covered loss due to the theft of a covered auto or non-owned auto, we will provide the death benefit provided your pet is inside that auto at the time of the theft and your pet is not recovered.18     ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS     When used in this Part IV: 1. \\u201cCollision\\u201d means the upset of a vehicle or its impact with another vehicle or     object. 2. \\u201cCustom parts or equipment\\u201d means equipment, devices, accessories,     enhancements and changes, other than those that are offered by the manu- facturer specifically for that auto model, or that are installed by the auto dealership as part of the original sale of a new auto, that: a. are permanently installed or attached; and b. alter the appearance or performance of the auto.     3. \\u201cMechanical parts\\u201d means operational parts on a vehicle that wear out over time or have a finite useful life or duration typically shorter than the life of the vehicle as a whole .

The insured person must reimburse us if we make a payment that we would not have made if this policy was not certified as proof of financial responsibility.     OTHER INSURANCE     If there is any other applicable liability insurance or bond, we will pay only our share of the damages .

The coverage provided under this policy for an insured person who sustains bodily injury while not occupying a motor vehicle shall be excess to any unin- sured motorist coverage or underinsured motorist coverage provided by a policy under which that insured person is a named insured. If you are injured while not occupying a motor vehicle and are also a named insured under any other policy, our coverage will pay the proportionate share that our limits bear to the total available uninsured motorist coverage or underinsured motorist coverage limits.     ARBITRATION     If we and an insured person cannot agree on: 1. the legal liability of the operator or owner of an uninsured motor vehicle or     underinsured motor vehicle; or 2. the amount of the damages sustained by the insured person; this will be determined by arbitration if we and the insured person mutually agree to arbitration prior to the expiration of the bodily injury statute of limitations in the state in which the accident occurred.     In the event of arbitration, each party will select an arbitrator . The two arbitrators will select a third.

If the trailer is not shown on the declarations page, the limit of liability is $500.     2. Payments for loss to a covered auto, non-owned auto, or custom parts or equipment are subject to the following provisions: a. If coverage applies to a non-owned auto, we will provide the broadest     coverage applicable to any covered auto shown on the declarations page.     b. If you have elected a Stated Amount for a covered auto, the Stated Amount is the most we will pay for all loss to that covered auto, includ- ing its custom parts or equipment.     c. Coverage for custom parts or equipment will not cause our limit of li- ability for loss to an auto under this Part IV to be increased to an amount in excess of the actual cash value of the auto, including its custom parts or equipment.     d. In determining the amount necessary to repair damaged property to its pre-loss condition, the amount to be paid by us: (i) will not exceed the prevailing competitive labor rates charged in the     area where the property is to be repaired and the cost of repair or replacement parts and equipment, as reasonably determined by us; and     (ii) will be based on the cost of repair or replacement parts and equip- ment which may be new, reconditioned, remanufactured or used, including, but not limited to: (a) original manufacturer parts or equipment; and (b) nonoriginal manufacturer parts or equipment.     e. To determine the amount necessary to repair or replace the damaged property as referred to in subsection 1., the total cost of necessary re- pair or replacement may be reduced by unrepaired prior damage . Un- repaired prior damage includes broken, cracked or missing parts; rust; dents; scrapes; gouges; and peeling paint. The reduction for unrepaired prior damage is the cost of labor, parts and materials necessary to repair or replace damage, deterioration, defects, or wear and tear on exterior body parts, windshields and other glass, wheels, and paint, that existed prior to the accident and that is eliminated as a result of the repair or replacement of property damaged in the loss.21     f. To determine the amount necessary to repair or replace the damaged property as referred to in subsection 1., an adjustment may be made for betterment or depreciation and physical condition on: (i) batteries; (ii) tires; (iii) engines and transmissions, if the engine has greater than 80,000     miles; and (iv) any other mechanical parts that are nonfunctioning or inoperative . We will not make an adjustment for the labor costs associated with the replacement or repair of these parts.     g. The actual cash value is determined by the market value, age, and con- dition of the vehicle at the time the loss occurs.     3. No deductible will apply to a loss to window glass when the glass is repaired instead of replaced.     4. Duplicate recovery for the same elements of damages is not permitted. 5. The following additional limits of liability apply to Pet Injury coverage:     a. The most we will pay for all damages in any one loss is a total of $1,000 regardless of the number of dogs or cats involved.     b. If your pet dies in, or as a direct result of, a covered loss, we will provide a death benefit of $1,000, less any payment we made toward veterinary expenses for your pet.     c. No deductible shall apply to this coverage.     PAYMENT OF LOSS     We may, at our option: 1. pay for the loss in money; or 2. repair or replace the damaged or stolen property.     At our expense, we may return any recovered stolen property to you or to the address shown on the declarations page, with payment for any damage result- ing from the theft. We may keep all or part of the property at the agreed or ap- praised value.     We may settle any loss with you or the owner or lienholder of the property.     NO BENEFIT TO BAILEE     Coverage under this Part IV will not directly or indirectly benefit any carrier or other bailee for hire.     LOSS PAYABLE CLAUSE     Payment under this Part IV for a loss to a covered auto will be made according to your interest and the interest of any lienholder shown on the declarations page or designated by you . At our option, payment may be made to both jointly,22     or to either separately . However, if the covered auto is not a total loss, we may make payment to you and the repairer of the auto.     The lienholder’s interest will not be protected: 1. where fraud, misrepresentation, material omission, or intentional damage     resulting in a denial of coverage by us has been committed by or at the direc- tion of you or any person seeking coverage; or     2. where the loss is otherwise not covered under the terms of this policy . If this policy is cancelled, nonrenewed or voided, the interest of any lienholder under this agreement will also terminate.     OTHER SOURCES OF RECOVERY     If other sources of recovery also cover the loss, we will pay only our share of the loss . Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits . However, any insurance we provide for a non-owned auto, or trailer not shown on the declarations page, will be excess over any other col- lectible source of recovery including, but not limited to: 1. any coverage provided by the owner of the non-owned auto or trailer; 2. any other applicable physical damage insurance; and 3. any other source of recovery applicable to the loss.\\n\\nMetadata: {'x-amz-bedrock-kb-source-uri': 's3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-document-page-number': 24.0, 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-chunk-id': '1%3A0%3ADeCPhJoB8T_-1QJqBSkV', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-data-source-id': '8L7KL1MIT4'}\\n\\nScore: 0.4309\\nDocument ID: s3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf\\nContent: INSURING AGREEMENT—RENTAL REIMBURSEMENT COVERAGE     We will reimburse rental charges incurred when you rent an auto from a rental agency or auto repair shop due to a loss to a covered auto for which Rental Re- imbursement Coverage has been purchased. This coverage applies only if you have purchased both Comprehensive Coverage and Collision Coverage for that covered auto and the loss is covered under one of those coverages.     Additional fees or charges for insurance, damage waivers, optional equipment, fuel, or accessories are not covered.     This coverage is limited to the each day limit shown on the declarations page for a maximum of 30 days.     If Rental Reimbursement Coverage applies, no other coverage under this policy for rental expenses will apply.     Rental charges will be reimbursed beginning: 1. when the covered auto cannot be driven due to a loss; or 2. if the covered auto can be driven, when you deliver the covered auto to an     auto repair shop or one of our Service Centers for repairs due to the loss; and ending the earliest of: 1. when the covered auto has been returned to you; 2. when the covered auto has been repaired; 3. when the covered auto has been replaced;17     4. 72 hours after we make an offer to settle the loss if the covered auto is deemed by us to be a total loss; or     5. when you incur 30 days worth of rental charges.     You must provide us written proof of your rental charges to be reimbursed.     INSURING AGREEMENT—LOAN/LEASE PAYOFF COVERAGE     If you pay the premium for this coverage, and the covered auto for which this coverage was purchased is deemed by us to be a total loss, we will pay, in addi- tion to any amounts otherwise payable under this Part IV, the difference between: 1. the actual cash value of the covered auto at the time of the total loss; and 2. any greater amount the owner of the covered auto is legally obligated to     pay under a written loan or lease agreement to which the covered auto is subject at the time of the total loss, reduced by: a. unpaid finance charges or refunds due to the owner for such charges; b. excess mileage charges or charges for wear and tear; c. charges for extended warranties or refunds due to the owner for extend-     ed warranties; d. charges for credit insurance or refunds due to the owner for credit insur-     ance; e. past due payments and charges for past due payments; and f. collection or repossession expenses.     However, our payment under this coverage shall not exceed the limit of liability shown on the declarations page . The limit of liability is a percentage of the ac- tual cash value of the covered auto at the time of the loss.     This coverage applies only if you have purchased both Comprehensive Cover- age and Collision Coverage for that covered auto and the loss is covered under one of those coverages.     INSURING AGREEMENT—PET INJURY COVERAGE     If you have purchased Collision coverage for at least one covered auto under your policy, and if your pet sustains injury or death while inside a covered auto or non-owned auto at the time of a loss covered under Collision or Comprehen- sive coverage, we will provide: 1. up to $1,000 for reasonable and customary veterinary fees incurred by you,     a relative, or a rated resident if your pet is injured in, or as a direct result of, the covered loss; or     2. a $1,000 death benefit if your pet dies in, or as a direct result of, the covered loss, less any payment we made toward veterinary expenses for your pet .     In the event of a covered loss due to the theft of a covered auto or non-owned auto, we will provide the death benefit provided your pet is inside that auto at the time of the theft and your pet is not recovered.18     ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS     When used in this Part IV: 1. “Collision” means the upset of a vehicle or its impact with another vehicle or     object. 2. “Custom parts or equipment” means equipment, devices, accessories,     enhancements and changes, other than those that are offered by the manu- facturer specifically for that auto model, or that are installed by the auto dealership as part of the original sale of a new auto, that: a. are permanently installed or attached; and b. alter the appearance or performance of the auto.     3. “Mechanical parts” means operational parts on a vehicle that wear out over time or have a finite useful life or duration typically shorter than the life of the vehicle as a whole .

FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LAWS     When we certify this policy as proof of financial responsibility, this policy will com- ply with the law to the extent required. The insured person must reimburse us if we make a payment that we would not have made if this policy was not certified as proof of financial responsibility.     OTHER INSURANCE     If there is any other applicable liability insurance or bond, we will pay only our share of the damages . Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits . However, any insurance we provide for a ve- hicle or trailer, other than a covered auto, will be excess over any other collect- ible insurance, self-insurance, or bond.7     OUT-OF-STATE COVERAGE     If an accident to which this Part I applies occurs in any state, territory or pos- session of the United States of America or any province or territory of Canada, other than the one in which a covered auto is principally garaged, and the state, province, territory or possession has: 1. a financial responsibility or similar law requiring limits of liability for bodily in-     jury or property damage higher than the limits shown on the declarations page, this policy will provide the higher limits; or     2. a compulsory insurance or similar law requiring a non-resident to maintain insurance whenever the non-resident uses an auto in that state, province, territory or possession, this policy will provide the greater of: a. the required minimum amounts and types of coverage; or b. the limits of liability under this policy.

If the two arbitrators cannot agree on a third arbitrator within 30 days, then on joint application by the insured person and us, the third arbitrator will be appointed by a court having jurisdiction.\\\\n\\\\nMetadata: {'x-amz-bedrock-kb-source-uri': 's3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-document-page-number': 16.0, 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-chunk-id': '1%3A0%3ACeCPhJoB8T_-1QJqBSkU', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-data-source-id': '8L7KL1MIT4'}\\\\n\\\\nScore: 0.4378\\\\nDocument ID: s3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf\\\\nContent: \\u201cUnderinsured motor vehicle\\u201d means a land motor vehicle or trailer of any type to which a bodily injury liability bond or policy applies at the time of the accident, but the sum of the limits of liability for bodily injury under all ap- plicable policies or bonds: a. is less than the coverage limit for Underinsured Motorist Coverage     shown on the declarations page of this policy; or b. has been reduced by payments for bodily injury to persons injured in     the accident, other than an insured person, to less than the coverage limit for Underinsured Motorist Coverage shown on the declarations page of this policy .

If coverage applies to a non-owned auto, we will provide the broadest     coverage applicable to any covered auto shown on the declarations page.     b. If you have elected a Stated Amount for a covered auto, the Stated Amount is the most we will pay for all loss to that covered auto, includ- ing its custom parts or equipment.     c. Coverage for custom parts or equipment will not cause our limit of li- ability for loss to an auto under this Part IV to be increased to an amount in excess of the actual cash value of the auto, including its custom parts or equipment.     d. In determining the amount necessary to repair damaged property to its pre-loss condition, the amount to be paid by us: (i) will not exceed the prevailing competitive labor rates charged in the     area where the property is to be repaired and the cost of repair or replacement parts and equipment, as reasonably determined by us; and     (ii) will be based on the cost of repair or replacement parts and equip- ment which may be new, reconditioned, remanufactured or used, including, but not limited to: (a) original manufacturer parts or equipment; and (b) nonoriginal manufacturer parts or equipment.     e.

Un- repaired prior damage includes broken, cracked or missing parts; rust; dents; scrapes; gouges; and peeling paint. The reduction for unrepaired prior damage is the cost of labor, parts and materials necessary to repair or replace damage, deterioration, defects, or wear and tear on exterior body parts, windshields and other glass, wheels, and paint, that existed prior to the accident and that is eliminated as a result of the repair or replacement of property damaged in the loss.21     f.

No deductible will apply to a loss to window glass when the glass is repaired instead of replaced.     4. Duplicate recovery for the same elements of damages is not permitted. 5. The following additional limits of liability apply to Pet Injury coverage:     a. The most we will pay for all damages in any one loss is a total of $1,000 regardless of the number of dogs or cats involved.     b. If your pet dies in, or as a direct result of, a covered loss, we will provide a death benefit of $1,000, less any payment we made toward veterinary expenses for your pet.     c. No deductible shall apply to this coverage.     PAYMENT OF LOSS     We may, at our option: 1. pay for the loss in money; or 2. repair or replace the damaged or stolen property.

FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LAWS     When we certify this policy as proof of financial responsibility, this policy will com- ply with the law to the extent required. The insured person must reimburse us if we make a payment that we would not have made if this policy was not certified as proof of financial responsibility.

We, or someone on our behalf, will determine: 1. whether the expenses for medical services are reasonable; and 2. whether the medical services are necessary.     ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS     When used in this Part II: 1. \\u201cInsured person\\u201d means:     a. you, a relative, or a rated resident: (i) while occupying an auto; or (ii) when struck by a motor vehicle or a trailer while not occupying a     self-propelled motorized vehicle; and b. any other person while occupying a covered auto with the permission     of you, a relative, or a rated resident. 2. \\u201cMedical services\\u201d means medical, surgical, chiropractic, dental, x-ray, am-     bulance, hospital, professional nursing, and funeral services, and includes the cost of eyeglasses, hearing aids, pharmaceuticals, orthopedics, and prosthetic devices.     3. \\u201cMotor vehicle\\u201d means a land motor vehicle designed for use principally on public roads.8     EXCLUSIONS\\u2014READ THE FOLLOWING EXCLUSIONS CAREFULLY .

Your failure to give any notice required by this policy within the time specified does not invalidate a claim made by you if you can show that it was not reasonably possible to give us notice within the prescribed time and that notice was given as soon as reasonably possible . Failure to give us notice within the prescribed time or as soon as reasonably possible does not bar our liability under this policy if you can prove that our rights and interests have not been prejudiced by your failure to give us notice as required.     A person seeking coverage must: 1. cooperate with us in any matter concerning a claim or lawsuit; 2. provide any written proof of loss we may reasonably require; 3. allow us to take signed and recorded statements, including sworn statements     and examinations under oath, which we may conduct outside the presence25     of you or any other person seeking coverage, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may reasonably require;     4. promptly call to notify us about any claim or lawsuit and send us any and all legal papers relating to the claim or suit;     5. attend hearings and trials as we require; 6. take reasonable steps after a loss to protect the covered auto, or any other     vehicle for which coverage is sought, from further loss .

CHANGES     This policy contract, your insurance application (which is made a part of this policy as if attached hereto), the declarations page, and all endorsements to this policy issued by us, contain all the agreements between you and us . Sub- ject to the following, the terms of this policy may not be changed or waived except by an endorsement issued by us.     The premium for this policy is based on information we received from you and other sources . You agree to cooperate with us in determining if this information is correct and complete, and to promptly notify us if it changes during the policy period. If this information is determined by us to be incorrect, incomplete, or if it changes during the policy period, you agree that we may adjust your policy information and premium accordingly . Changes that may result in a premium ad- justment are contained in our rates and rules . These include, but are not limited to, you, a relative, or a rated resident obtaining a driver\\u2019s license or operator\\u2019s permit, or changes in: 1. the number, type or use classification of covered autos; 2. the persons who regularly operate a covered auto; 3. the persons of legal driving age residing in your household;26     4. the residents in your household; 5. an operator\\u2019s marital status; 6. your mailing address and your residence address; 7. the principal garaging address of any covered auto; 8. coverage, deductibles, or limits of liability; or 9. rating territory or discount eligibility.     The coverage provided in your policy may be changed only by the issuance of a new policy or an endorsement by us . However, if during the policy period we broaden any coverage afforded under the current edition of your policy without additional premium charge, that change will automatically apply to your policy as of the date the coverage change is implemented in your state.     If you ask us to delete a vehicle from this policy, no coverage will apply to that vehicle as of the date and time you ask us to delete it.     DUTY TO REPORT CHANGES     You must promptly report to us all changes, including additions and deletions, in policy information.

SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS     We may use estimating, appraisal, or injury evaluation systems to assist us in adjusting claims under this policy and to assist us in determining the amount of damages, expenses, or loss payable under this policy . Such systems may be developed by us or a third party and may include computer software, databases, and specialized technology.     TERMS OF POLICY CONFORMED TO STATUTES     If any provision of this policy fails to conform to the statutes of the state listed on your application as your residence, the provision shall be deemed amended to conform to such statutes .

No one is entitled to duplicate payments for the same elements of damages.     Any payment to a person under this Part I will be reduced by any payment to that person under Part III—Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage.

In the event of arbitration, each party will select an arbitrator . The two arbitrators will select a third.

Payments for loss to a covered auto, non-owned auto, or custom parts or equipment are subject to the following provisions: a. If coverage applies to a non-owned auto, we will provide the broadest     coverage applicable to any covered auto shown on the declarations page.     b. If you have elected a Stated Amount for a covered auto, the Stated Amount is the most we will pay for all loss to that covered auto, includ- ing its custom parts or equipment.     c. Coverage for custom parts or equipment will not cause our limit of li- ability for loss to an auto under this Part IV to be increased to an amount in excess of the actual cash value of the auto, including its custom parts or equipment.     d. In determining the amount necessary to repair damaged property to its pre-loss condition, the amount to be paid by us: (i) will not exceed the prevailing competitive labor rates charged in the     area where the property is to be repaired and the cost of repair or replacement parts and equipment, as reasonably determined by us; and     (ii) will be based on the cost of repair or replacement parts and equip- ment which may be new, reconditioned, remanufactured or used, including, but not limited to: (a) original manufacturer parts or equipment; and (b) nonoriginal manufacturer parts or equipment.     e. To determine the amount necessary to repair or replace the damaged property as referred to in subsection 1., the total cost of necessary re- pair or replacement may be reduced by unrepaired prior damage . Un- repaired prior damage includes broken, cracked or missing parts; rust; dents; scrapes; gouges; and peeling paint. The reduction for unrepaired prior damage is the cost of labor, parts and materials necessary to repair or replace damage, deterioration, defects, or wear and tear on exterior body parts, windshields and other glass, wheels, and paint, that existed prior to the accident and that is eliminated as a result of the repair or replacement of property damaged in the loss.21     f.

If your pet dies in, or as a direct result of, a covered loss, we will provide a death benefit of $1,000, less any payment we made toward veterinary expenses for your pet.     c. No deductible shall apply to this coverage.     PAYMENT OF LOSS     We may, at our option: 1. pay for the loss in money; or 2. repair or replace the damaged or stolen property.     At our expense, we may return any recovered stolen property to you or to the address shown on the declarations page, with payment for any damage result- ing from the theft. We may keep all or part of the property at the agreed or ap- praised value.     We may settle any loss with you or the owner or lienholder of the property.

However, our payment under this coverage shall not exceed the limit of liability shown on the declarations page . The limit of liability is a percentage of the ac- tual cash value of the covered auto at the time of the loss.     This coverage applies only if you have purchased both Comprehensive Cover- age and Collision Coverage for that covered auto and the loss is covered under one of those coverages.     INSURING AGREEMENT—PET INJURY COVERAGE     If you have purchased Collision coverage for at least one covered auto under your policy, and if your pet sustains injury or death while inside a covered auto or non-owned auto at the time of a loss covered under Collision or Comprehen- sive coverage, we will provide: 1. up to $1,000 for reasonable and customary veterinary fees incurred by you,     a relative, or a rated resident if your pet is injured in, or as a direct result of, the covered loss; or     2. a $1,000 death benefit if your pet dies in, or as a direct result of, the covered loss, less any payment we made toward veterinary expenses for your pet .

CHANGES     This policy contract, your insurance application (which is made a part of this policy as if attached hereto), the declarations page, and all endorsements to this policy issued by us, contain all the agreements between you and us . Sub- ject to the following, the terms of this policy may not be changed or waived except by an endorsement issued by us.     The premium for this policy is based on information we received from you and other sources . You agree to cooperate with us in determining if this information is correct and complete, and to promptly notify us if it changes during the policy period. If this information is determined by us to be incorrect, incomplete, or if it changes during the policy period, you agree that we may adjust your policy information and premium accordingly .

If you ask us to delete a vehicle from this policy, no coverage will apply to that vehicle as of the date and time you ask us to delete it.

SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS     We may use estimating, appraisal, or injury evaluation systems to assist us in adjusting claims under this policy and to assist us in determining the amount of damages, expenses, or loss payable under this policy . Such systems may be developed by us or a third party and may include computer software, databases, and specialized technology.     TERMS OF POLICY CONFORMED TO STATUTES     If any provision of this policy fails to conform to the statutes of the state listed on your application as your residence, the provision shall be deemed amended to conform to such statutes .

Coverage under this Part V will not apply to: 1. more than three covered emergencies for any single covered auto in a six-     month period; 2. the cost of purchasing parts, fluid, lubricants, fuel, or replacement keys, or     the labor to make replacement keys; 3. installation of products or material not related to the disablement; 4. labor not related to the disablement; 5. labor on a covered disabled auto for any time period in excess of 60 min-     utes per disablement; 6. towing or storage related to impoundment, abandonment, illegal parking, or     other violations of law; 7. assistance with jacks, levelers, airbags or awnings; 8. labor or repair work performed at a service station, garage, or repair shop; 9. auto storage charges; 10. disablement that occurs on roads not regularly maintained, sand beaches,     open fields, or areas designated as not passable due to construction, weath- er, or earth movement;     11. mounting or removing of snow tires or chains; 12. tire repair; 13. disablement that results from an intentional or willful act or action by you, a     relative, or the operator of a covered disabled auto; 14. any covered auto while being used in connection with ride-sharing activity; 15. any covered auto while being used in connection with a personal vehicle     sharing program; or 16. a trailer.24     UNAUTHORIZED SERVICE PROVIDER     When service is rendered by a provider in the business of providing roadside assistance and towing services, other than one of our authorized service repre- sentatives, we will pay only reasonable charges, as determined by us, for: 1. towing of a covered disabled auto to the nearest qualified repair facility; and 2. labor on a covered disabled auto at the place of disablement; which is necessary due to a covered emergency.     OTHER INSURANCE     Any coverage provided under this Part V for service rendered by an unauthor- ized service provider will be excess over any other collectible insurance or towing protection coverage.     PART VI—DUTIES IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT OR LOSS     For coverage to apply under this policy, you or the person seeking coverage must promptly report each accident or loss even if you or the person seeking coverage is not at fault. You or the person seeking coverage must provide us with all accident or loss information, including time, place, and how the accident or loss happened. You or the person seeking coverage must also obtain and provide us the names and addresses of all persons involved in the accident or loss, the names and addresses of any witnesses, and the license plate numbers of the vehicles involved.     If you or the person seeking coverage cannot identify the owner or operator of a vehicle involved in the accident, or if theft or vandalism has occurred, you or the person seeking coverage must notify the police within 24 hours or as soon as practicable.     Notice of an accident or loss given by you to any agent authorized by us within the State of Wisconsin, with particulars sufficient to identify you as an insured person, is notice to us . Your failure to give any notice required by this policy within the time specified does not invalidate a claim made by you if you can show that it was not reasonably possible to give us notice within the prescribed time and that notice was given as soon as reasonably possible . Failure to give us notice within the prescribed time or as soon as reasonably possible does not bar our liability under this policy if you can prove that our rights and interests have not been prejudiced by your failure to give us notice as required.     A person seeking coverage must: 1. cooperate with us in any matter concerning a claim or lawsuit; 2. provide any written proof of loss we may reasonably require; 3. allow us to take signed and recorded statements, including sworn statements     and examinations under oath, which we may conduct outside the presence25     of you or any other person seeking coverage, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may reasonably require;     4. promptly call to notify us about any claim or lawsuit and send us any and all legal papers relating to the claim or suit;     5. attend hearings and trials as we require; 6. take reasonable steps after a loss to protect the covered auto, or any other     vehicle for which coverage is sought, from further loss .\\n\\nMetadata: {'x-amz-bedrock-kb-source-uri': 's3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-document-page-number': 26.0, 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-chunk-id': '1%3A0%3AD-CPhJoB8T_-1QJqBSkV', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-data-source-id': '8L7KL1MIT4'}\"}], 'toolUseId': 'tooluse_ZJGrxJ3ZG2P1EJ1uT8XPn3', 'status': 'success'}}], 'role': 'user'}], 'system': [{'text': 'You are an expert automotive claims validaiton specialist that determines if the users auto insurance claim is valid based on the provided information and details within the policy contract.\\n    \\nYou will be provided with JSON data that has claim information and vehicle damage information, you should:\\n1.

If the trailer is not shown on the declarations page, the limit of liability is $500.     2. Payments for loss to a covered auto, non-owned auto, or custom parts or equipment are subject to the following provisions: a. If coverage applies to a non-owned auto, we will provide the broadest     coverage applicable to any covered auto shown on the declarations page.     b. If you have elected a Stated Amount for a covered auto, the Stated Amount is the most we will pay for all loss to that covered auto, includ- ing its custom parts or equipment.     c. Coverage for custom parts or equipment will not cause our limit of li- ability for loss to an auto under this Part IV to be increased to an amount in excess of the actual cash value of the auto, including its custom parts or equipment.     d. In determining the amount necessary to repair damaged property to its pre-loss condition, the amount to be paid by us: (i) will not exceed the prevailing competitive labor rates charged in the     area where the property is to be repaired and the cost of repair or replacement parts and equipment, as reasonably determined by us; and     (ii) will be based on the cost of repair or replacement parts and equip- ment which may be new, reconditioned, remanufactured or used, including, but not limited to: (a) original manufacturer parts or equipment; and (b) nonoriginal manufacturer parts or equipment.     e. To determine the amount necessary to repair or replace the damaged property as referred to in subsection 1., the total cost of necessary re- pair or replacement may be reduced by unrepaired prior damage . Un- repaired prior damage includes broken, cracked or missing parts; rust; dents; scrapes; gouges; and peeling paint. The reduction for unrepaired prior damage is the cost of labor, parts and materials necessary to repair or replace damage, deterioration, defects, or wear and tear on exterior body parts, windshields and other glass, wheels, and paint, that existed prior to the accident and that is eliminated as a result of the repair or replacement of property damaged in the loss.21     f. To determine the amount necessary to repair or replace the damaged property as referred to in subsection 1., an adjustment may be made for betterment or depreciation and physical condition on: (i) batteries; (ii) tires; (iii) engines and transmissions, if the engine has greater than 80,000     miles; and (iv) any other mechanical parts that are nonfunctioning or inoperative . We will not make an adjustment for the labor costs associated with the replacement or repair of these parts.     g. The actual cash value is determined by the market value, age, and con- dition of the vehicle at the time the loss occurs.     3. No deductible will apply to a loss to window glass when the glass is repaired instead of replaced.     4. Duplicate recovery for the same elements of damages is not permitted. 5. The following additional limits of liability apply to Pet Injury coverage:     a. The most we will pay for all damages in any one loss is a total of $1,000 regardless of the number of dogs or cats involved.     b. If your pet dies in, or as a direct result of, a covered loss, we will provide a death benefit of $1,000, less any payment we made toward veterinary expenses for your pet.     c. No deductible shall apply to this coverage.     PAYMENT OF LOSS     We may, at our option: 1. pay for the loss in money; or 2. repair or replace the damaged or stolen property.     At our expense, we may return any recovered stolen property to you or to the address shown on the declarations page, with payment for any damage result- ing from the theft. We may keep all or part of the property at the agreed or ap- praised value.     We may settle any loss with you or the owner or lienholder of the property.     NO BENEFIT TO BAILEE     Coverage under this Part IV will not directly or indirectly benefit any carrier or other bailee for hire.     LOSS PAYABLE CLAUSE     Payment under this Part IV for a loss to a covered auto will be made according to your interest and the interest of any lienholder shown on the declarations page or designated by you . At our option, payment may be made to both jointly,22     or to either separately . However, if the covered auto is not a total loss, we may make payment to you and the repairer of the auto.     The lienholder\\u2019s interest will not be protected: 1. where fraud, misrepresentation, material omission, or intentional damage     resulting in a denial of coverage by us has been committed by or at the direc- tion of you or any person seeking coverage; or     2. where the loss is otherwise not covered under the terms of this policy . If this policy is cancelled, nonrenewed or voided, the interest of any lienholder under this agreement will also terminate.     OTHER SOURCES OF RECOVERY     If other sources of recovery also cover the loss, we will pay only our share of the loss . Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits . However, any insurance we provide for a non-owned auto, or trailer not shown on the declarations page, will be excess over any other col- lectible source of recovery including, but not limited to: 1. any coverage provided by the owner of the non-owned auto or trailer; 2. any other applicable physical damage insurance; and 3. any other source of recovery applicable to the loss.\\\\n\\\\nMetadata: {'x-amz-bedrock-kb-source-uri': 's3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-document-page-number': 24.0, 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-chunk-id': '1%3A0%3ADeCPhJoB8T_-1QJqBSkV', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-data-source-id': '8L7KL1MIT4'}\\\\n\\\\nScore: 0.4309\\\\nDocument ID: s3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf\\\\nContent: INSURING AGREEMENT\\u2014RENTAL REIMBURSEMENT COVERAGE     We will reimburse rental charges incurred when you rent an auto from a rental agency or auto repair shop due to a loss to a covered auto for which Rental Re- imbursement Coverage has been purchased. This coverage applies only if you have purchased both Comprehensive Coverage and Collision Coverage for that covered auto and the loss is covered under one of those coverages.     Additional fees or charges for insurance, damage waivers, optional equipment, fuel, or accessories are not covered.     This coverage is limited to the each day limit shown on the declarations page for a maximum of 30 days.     If Rental Reimbursement Coverage applies, no other coverage under this policy for rental expenses will apply.

You must provide us written proof of your rental charges to be reimbursed.     INSURING AGREEMENT\\u2014LOAN/LEASE PAYOFF COVERAGE     If you pay the premium for this coverage, and the covered auto for which this coverage was purchased is deemed by us to be a total loss, we will pay, in addi- tion to any amounts otherwise payable under this Part IV, the difference between: 1. the actual cash value of the covered auto at the time of the total loss; and 2. any greater amount the owner of the covered auto is legally obligated to     pay under a written loan or lease agreement to which the covered auto is subject at the time of the total loss, reduced by: a. unpaid finance charges or refunds due to the owner for such charges; b. excess mileage charges or charges for wear and tear; c. charges for extended warranties or refunds due to the owner for extend-     ed warranties; d. charges for credit insurance or refunds due to the owner for credit insur-     ance; e. past due payments and charges for past due payments; and f. collection or repossession expenses.     However, our payment under this coverage shall not exceed the limit of liability shown on the declarations page . The limit of liability is a percentage of the ac- tual cash value of the covered auto at the time of the loss.     This coverage applies only if you have purchased both Comprehensive Cover- age and Collision Coverage for that covered auto and the loss is covered under one of those coverages.     INSURING AGREEMENT\\u2014PET INJURY COVERAGE     If you have purchased Collision coverage for at least one covered auto under your policy, and if your pet sustains injury or death while inside a covered auto or non-owned auto at the time of a loss covered under Collision or Comprehen- sive coverage, we will provide: 1. up to $1,000 for reasonable and customary veterinary fees incurred by you,     a relative, or a rated resident if your pet is injured in, or as a direct result of, the covered loss; or     2. a $1,000 death benefit if your pet dies in, or as a direct result of, the covered loss, less any payment we made toward veterinary expenses for your pet .     In the event of a covered loss due to the theft of a covered auto or non-owned auto, we will provide the death benefit provided your pet is inside that auto at the time of the theft and your pet is not recovered.18     ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS     When used in this Part IV: 1. \\u201cCollision\\u201d means the upset of a vehicle or its impact with another vehicle or     object. 2. \\u201cCustom parts or equipment\\u201d means equipment, devices, accessories,     enhancements and changes, other than those that are offered by the manu- facturer specifically for that auto model, or that are installed by the auto dealership as part of the original sale of a new auto, that: a. are permanently installed or attached; and b. alter the appearance or performance of the auto.     3. \\u201cMechanical parts\\u201d means operational parts on a vehicle that wear out over time or have a finite useful life or duration typically shorter than the life of the vehicle as a whole .

An auto and attached trailer are considered one auto . Therefore, the limits of li- ability will not be increased for an accident involving an auto that has an attached trailer.     FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LAWS     When we certify this policy as proof of financial responsibility, this policy will com- ply with the law to the extent required. The insured person must reimburse us if we make a payment that we would not have made if this policy was not certified as proof of financial responsibility.     OTHER INSURANCE     If there is any other applicable liability insurance or bond, we will pay only our share of the damages .

Your failure to give any notice required by this policy within the time specified does not invalidate a claim made by you if you can show that it was not reasonably possible to give us notice within the prescribed time and that notice was given as soon as reasonably possible . Failure to give us notice within the prescribed time or as soon as reasonably possible does not bar our liability under this policy if you can prove that our rights and interests have not been prejudiced by your failure to give us notice as required.     A person seeking coverage must: 1. cooperate with us in any matter concerning a claim or lawsuit; 2. provide any written proof of loss we may reasonably require; 3. allow us to take signed and recorded statements, including sworn statements     and examinations under oath, which we may conduct outside the presence25     of you or any other person seeking coverage, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may reasonably require;     4. promptly call to notify us about any claim or lawsuit and send us any and all legal papers relating to the claim or suit;     5. attend hearings and trials as we require; 6. take reasonable steps after a loss to protect the covered auto, or any other     vehicle for which coverage is sought, from further loss . We will pay reason- able expenses incurred in providing that protection.

CHANGES     This policy contract, your insurance application (which is made a part of this policy as if attached hereto), the declarations page, and all endorsements to this policy issued by us, contain all the agreements between you and us . Sub- ject to the following, the terms of this policy may not be changed or waived except by an endorsement issued by us.     The premium for this policy is based on information we received from you and other sources . You agree to cooperate with us in determining if this information is correct and complete, and to promptly notify us if it changes during the policy period. If this information is determined by us to be incorrect, incomplete, or if it changes during the policy period, you agree that we may adjust your policy information and premium accordingly . Changes that may result in a premium ad- justment are contained in our rates and rules . These include, but are not limited to, you, a relative, or a rated resident obtaining a driver\\u2019s license or operator\\u2019s permit, or changes in: 1. the number, type or use classification of covered autos; 2. the persons who regularly operate a covered auto; 3. the persons of legal driving age residing in your household;26     4. the residents in your household; 5. an operator\\u2019s marital status; 6. your mailing address and your residence address; 7. the principal garaging address of any covered auto; 8. coverage, deductibles, or limits of liability; or 9. rating territory or discount eligibility.     The coverage provided in your policy may be changed only by the issuance of a new policy or an endorsement by us . However, if during the policy period we broaden any coverage afforded under the current edition of your policy without additional premium charge, that change will automatically apply to your policy as of the date the coverage change is implemented in your state.

PART VI\\u2014DUTIES IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT OR LOSS     For coverage to apply under this policy, you or the person seeking coverage must promptly report each accident or loss even if you or the person seeking coverage is not at fault. You or the person seeking coverage must provide us with all accident or loss information, including time, place, and how the accident or loss happened. You or the person seeking coverage must also obtain and provide us the names and addresses of all persons involved in the accident or loss, the names and addresses of any witnesses, and the license plate numbers of the vehicles involved.     If you or the person seeking coverage cannot identify the owner or operator of a vehicle involved in the accident, or if theft or vandalism has occurred, you or the person seeking coverage must notify the police within 24 hours or as soon as practicable.     Notice of an accident or loss given by you to any agent authorized by us within the State of Wisconsin, with particulars sufficient to identify you as an insured person, is notice to us . Your failure to give any notice required by this policy within the time specified does not invalidate a claim made by you if you can show that it was not reasonably possible to give us notice within the prescribed time and that notice was given as soon as reasonably possible . Failure to give us notice within the prescribed time or as soon as reasonably possible does not bar our liability under this policy if you can prove that our rights and interests have not been prejudiced by your failure to give us notice as required.     A person seeking coverage must: 1. cooperate with us in any matter concerning a claim or lawsuit; 2. provide any written proof of loss we may reasonably require; 3. allow us to take signed and recorded statements, including sworn statements     and examinations under oath, which we may conduct outside the presence25     of you or any other person seeking coverage, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may reasonably require;     4. promptly call to notify us about any claim or lawsuit and send us any and all legal papers relating to the claim or suit;     5. attend hearings and trials as we require; 6. take reasonable steps after a loss to protect the covered auto, or any other     vehicle for which coverage is sought, from further loss .\\\\n\\\\nMetadata: {'x-amz-bedrock-kb-source-uri': 's3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-document-page-number': 26.0, 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-chunk-id': '1%3A0%3AD-CPhJoB8T_-1QJqBSkV', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-data-source-id': '8L7KL1MIT4'}\\\"}]}}]\"\n",

ADDITIONAL DEFINITION     When used in this Part I: \\u201cInsured person\\u201d means: a. you, a relative, or a rated resident with respect to an accident arising out of     the ownership, maintenance or use of an auto or a trailer; b. any person with respect to an accident arising out of that person\\u2019s use of a     covered auto with the permission of you, a relative, or a rated resident; c. any person or organization with respect only to vicarious liability for the acts     or omissions of a person described in a. or b . above; and d. any \\u201cAdditional Interest\\u201d shown on the declarations page with respect only     to its liability for the acts or omissions of a person described in a. or b . above.\\\\n\\\\nMetadata: {'x-amz-bedrock-kb-source-uri': 's3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-document-page-number': 5.0, 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-chunk-id': '1%3A0%3AAuCPhJoB8T_-1QJqBSkT', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-data-source-id': '8L7KL1MIT4'}\\\\n\\\\nScore: 0.4316\\\\nDocument ID: s3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf\\\\nContent: b. a trailer is the limit of liability shown on the declarations page for that trailer . If the trailer is not shown on the declarations page, the limit of liability is $500.     2. Payments for loss to a covered auto, non-owned auto, or custom parts or equipment are subject to the following provisions: a. If coverage applies to a non-owned auto, we will provide the broadest     coverage applicable to any covered auto shown on the declarations page.     b. If you have elected a Stated Amount for a covered auto, the Stated Amount is the most we will pay for all loss to that covered auto, includ- ing its custom parts or equipment.     c. Coverage for custom parts or equipment will not cause our limit of li- ability for loss to an auto under this Part IV to be increased to an amount in excess of the actual cash value of the auto, including its custom parts or equipment.     d. In determining the amount necessary to repair damaged property to its pre-loss condition, the amount to be paid by us: (i) will not exceed the prevailing competitive labor rates charged in the     area where the property is to be repaired and the cost of repair or replacement parts and equipment, as reasonably determined by us; and     (ii) will be based on the cost of repair or replacement parts and equip- ment which may be new, reconditioned, remanufactured or used, including, but not limited to: (a) original manufacturer parts or equipment; and (b) nonoriginal manufacturer parts or equipment.     e. To determine the amount necessary to repair or replace the damaged property as referred to in subsection 1., the total cost of necessary re- pair or replacement may be reduced by unrepaired prior damage . Un- repaired prior damage includes broken, cracked or missing parts; rust; dents; scrapes; gouges; and peeling paint. The reduction for unrepaired prior damage is the cost of labor, parts and materials necessary to repair or replace damage, deterioration, defects, or wear and tear on exterior body parts, windshields and other glass, wheels, and paint, that existed prior to the accident and that is eliminated as a result of the repair or replacement of property damaged in the loss.21     f. To determine the amount necessary to repair or replace the damaged property as referred to in subsection 1., an adjustment may be made for betterment or depreciation and physical condition on: (i) batteries; (ii) tires; (iii) engines and transmissions, if the engine has greater than 80,000     miles; and (iv) any other mechanical parts that are nonfunctioning or inoperative . We will not make an adjustment for the labor costs associated with the replacement or repair of these parts.     g. The actual cash value is determined by the market value, age, and con- dition of the vehicle at the time the loss occurs.     3. No deductible will apply to a loss to window glass when the glass is repaired instead of replaced.     4. Duplicate recovery for the same elements of damages is not permitted. 5. The following additional limits of liability apply to Pet Injury coverage:     a. The most we will pay for all damages in any one loss is a total of $1,000 regardless of the number of dogs or cats involved.     b. If your pet dies in, or as a direct result of, a covered loss, we will provide a death benefit of $1,000, less any payment we made toward veterinary expenses for your pet.     c. No deductible shall apply to this coverage.     PAYMENT OF LOSS     We may, at our option: 1. pay for the loss in money; or 2. repair or replace the damaged or stolen property.     At our expense, we may return any recovered stolen property to you or to the address shown on the declarations page, with payment for any damage result- ing from the theft. We may keep all or part of the property at the agreed or ap- praised value.     We may settle any loss with you or the owner or lienholder of the property.     NO BENEFIT TO BAILEE     Coverage under this Part IV will not directly or indirectly benefit any carrier or other bailee for hire.     LOSS PAYABLE CLAUSE     Payment under this Part IV for a loss to a covered auto will be made according to your interest and the interest of any lienholder shown on the declarations page or designated by you . At our option, payment may be made to both jointly,22     or to either separately . However, if the covered auto is not a total loss, we may make payment to you and the repairer of the auto.     The lienholder\\u2019s interest will not be protected: 1. where fraud, misrepresentation, material omission, or intentional damage     resulting in a denial of coverage by us has been committed by or at the direc- tion of you or any person seeking coverage; or     2. where the loss is otherwise not covered under the terms of this policy . If this policy is cancelled, nonrenewed or voided, the interest of any lienholder under this agreement will also terminate.     OTHER SOURCES OF RECOVERY     If other sources of recovery also cover the loss, we will pay only our share of the loss . Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits . However, any insurance we provide for a non-owned auto, or trailer not shown on the declarations page, will be excess over any other col- lectible source of recovery including, but not limited to: 1. any coverage provided by the owner of the non-owned auto or trailer; 2. any other applicable physical damage insurance; and 3. any other source of recovery applicable to the loss.\\\\n\\\\nMetadata: {'x-amz-bedrock-kb-source-uri': 's3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-document-page-number': 24.0, 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-chunk-id': '1%3A0%3ADeCPhJoB8T_-1QJqBSkV', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-data-source-id': '8L7KL1MIT4'}\\\\n\\\\nScore: 0.4309\\\\nDocument ID: s3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf\\\\nContent: INSURING AGREEMENT\\u2014RENTAL REIMBURSEMENT COVERAGE     We will reimburse rental charges incurred when you rent an auto from a rental agency or auto repair shop due to a loss to a covered auto for which Rental Re- imbursement Coverage has been purchased. This coverage applies only if you have purchased both Comprehensive Coverage and Collision Coverage for that covered auto and the loss is covered under one of those coverages.     Additional fees or charges for insurance, damage waivers, optional equipment, fuel, or accessories are not covered.     This coverage is limited to the each day limit shown on the declarations page for a maximum of 30 days.     If Rental Reimbursement Coverage applies, no other coverage under this policy for rental expenses will apply.     Rental charges will be reimbursed beginning: 1. when the covered auto cannot be driven due to a loss; or 2. if the covered auto can be driven, when you deliver the covered auto to an     auto repair shop or one of our Service Centers for repairs due to the loss; and ending the earliest of: 1. when the covered auto has been returned to you; 2. when the covered auto has been repaired; 3. when the covered auto has been replaced;17     4. 72 hours after we make an offer to settle the loss if the covered auto is deemed by us to be a total loss; or     5. when you incur 30 days worth of rental charges.     You must provide us written proof of your rental charges to be reimbursed.     INSURING AGREEMENT\\u2014LOAN/LEASE PAYOFF COVERAGE     If you pay the premium for this coverage, and the covered auto for which this coverage was purchased is deemed by us to be a total loss, we will pay, in addi- tion to any amounts otherwise payable under this Part IV, the difference between: 1. the actual cash value of the covered auto at the time of the total loss; and 2. any greater amount the owner of the covered auto is legally obligated to     pay under a written loan or lease agreement to which the covered auto is subject at the time of the total loss, reduced by: a. unpaid finance charges or refunds due to the owner for such charges; b. excess mileage charges or charges for wear and tear; c. charges for extended warranties or refunds due to the owner for extend-     ed warranties; d. charges for credit insurance or refunds due to the owner for credit insur-     ance; e. past due payments and charges for past due payments; and f. collection or repossession expenses.     However, our payment under this coverage shall not exceed the limit of liability shown on the declarations page . The limit of liability is a percentage of the ac- tual cash value of the covered auto at the time of the loss.     This coverage applies only if you have purchased both Comprehensive Cover- age and Collision Coverage for that covered auto and the loss is covered under one of those coverages.     INSURING AGREEMENT\\u2014PET INJURY COVERAGE     If you have purchased Collision coverage for at least one covered auto under your policy, and if your pet sustains injury or death while inside a covered auto or non-owned auto at the time of a loss covered under Collision or Comprehen- sive coverage, we will provide: 1. up to $1,000 for reasonable and customary veterinary fees incurred by you,     a relative, or a rated resident if your pet is injured in, or as a direct result of, the covered loss; or     2. a $1,000 death benefit if your pet dies in, or as a direct result of, the covered loss, less any payment we made toward veterinary expenses for your pet .     In the event of a covered loss due to the theft of a covered auto or non-owned auto, we will provide the death benefit provided your pet is inside that auto at the time of the theft and your pet is not recovered.18     ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS     When used in this Part IV: 1. \\u201cCollision\\u201d means the upset of a vehicle or its impact with another vehicle or     object. 2. \\u201cCustom parts or equipment\\u201d means equipment, devices, accessories,     enhancements and changes, other than those that are offered by the manu- facturer specifically for that auto model, or that are installed by the auto dealership as part of the original sale of a new auto, that: a. are permanently installed or attached; and b. alter the appearance or performance of the auto.     3. \\u201cMechanical parts\\u201d means operational parts on a vehicle that wear out over time or have a finite useful life or duration typically shorter than the life of the vehicle as a whole .

If multiple auto policies issued by us are in effect for you, we will pay no more than the highest limit of liability for this coverage available under any one policy.     An auto and attached trailer are considered one auto . Therefore, the limits of li- ability will not be increased for an accident involving an auto that has an attached trailer.     FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LAWS     When we certify this policy as proof of financial responsibility, this policy will com- ply with the law to the extent required. The insured person must reimburse us if we make a payment that we would not have made if this policy was not certified as proof of financial responsibility.     OTHER INSURANCE     If there is any other applicable liability insurance or bond, we will pay only our share of the damages . Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits . However, any insurance we provide for a ve- hicle or trailer, other than a covered auto, will be excess over any other collect- ible insurance, self-insurance, or bond.7     OUT-OF-STATE COVERAGE     If an accident to which this Part I applies occurs in any state, territory or pos- session of the United States of America or any province or territory of Canada, other than the one in which a covered auto is principally garaged, and the state, province, territory or possession has: 1. a financial responsibility or similar law requiring limits of liability for bodily in-     jury or property damage higher than the limits shown on the declarations page, this policy will provide the higher limits; or     2. a compulsory insurance or similar law requiring a non-resident to maintain insurance whenever the non-resident uses an auto in that state, province, territory or possession, this policy will provide the greater of: a. the required minimum amounts and types of coverage; or b. the limits of liability under this policy.     PART II\\u2014MEDICAL PAYMENTS COVERAGE     INSURING AGREEMENT     If you pay the premium for this coverage, we will pay the reasonable expenses incurred for necessary medical services received within three years from the date of a motor vehicle accident because of bodily injury: 1. sustained by an insured person; and 2. caused by that motor vehicle accident.

Your failure to give any notice required by this policy within the time specified does not invalidate a claim made by you if you can show that it was not reasonably possible to give us notice within the prescribed time and that notice was given as soon as reasonably possible . Failure to give us notice within the prescribed time or as soon as reasonably possible does not bar our liability under this policy if you can prove that our rights and interests have not been prejudiced by your failure to give us notice as required.     A person seeking coverage must: 1. cooperate with us in any matter concerning a claim or lawsuit; 2. provide any written proof of loss we may reasonably require; 3. allow us to take signed and recorded statements, including sworn statements     and examinations under oath, which we may conduct outside the presence25     of you or any other person seeking coverage, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may reasonably require;     4. promptly call to notify us about any claim or lawsuit and send us any and all legal papers relating to the claim or suit;     5. attend hearings and trials as we require; 6. take reasonable steps after a loss to protect the covered auto, or any other     vehicle for which coverage is sought, from further loss .

The coverage provided in your policy may be changed only by the issuance of a new policy or an endorsement by us .

If you ask us to delete a vehicle from this policy, no coverage will apply to that vehicle as of the date and time you ask us to delete it.     DUTY TO REPORT CHANGES     You must promptly report to us all changes, including additions and deletions, in policy information.

Notice of an accident or loss given by you to any agent authorized by us within the State of Wisconsin, with particulars sufficient to identify you as an insured person, is notice to us . Your failure to give any notice required by this policy within the time specified does not invalidate a claim made by you if you can show that it was not reasonably possible to give us notice within the prescribed time and that notice was given as soon as reasonably possible . Failure to give us notice within the prescribed time or as soon as reasonably possible does not bar our liability under this policy if you can prove that our rights and interests have not been prejudiced by your failure to give us notice as required.     A person seeking coverage must: 1. cooperate with us in any matter concerning a claim or lawsuit; 2. provide any written proof of loss we may reasonably require; 3. allow us to take signed and recorded statements, including sworn statements     and examinations under oath, which we may conduct outside the presence25     of you or any other person seeking coverage, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may reasonably require;     4. promptly call to notify us about any claim or lawsuit and send us any and all legal papers relating to the claim or suit;     5. attend hearings and trials as we require; 6. take reasonable steps after a loss to protect the covered auto, or any other     vehicle for which coverage is sought, from further loss .\\\\n\\\\nMetadata: {'x-amz-bedrock-kb-source-uri': 's3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-document-page-number': 26.0, 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-chunk-id': '1%3A0%3AD-CPhJoB8T_-1QJqBSkV', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-data-source-id': '8L7KL1MIT4'}\\\"}]}}]\"\n",

The \\u201ceach person\\u201d limit of liability includes the total of all claims made for bodily injury to an insured person and all claims of others derived from such bodily injury, including, but not limited to, emotional injury or mental anguish resulting from the bodily injury of another or from witnessing the bodily injury to an- other, loss of society, loss of companionship, loss of services, loss of consortium, and wrongful death.     If the declarations page shows that \\u201ccombined single limit\\u201d or \\u201cCSL\\u201d applies, the amount shown is the most we will pay for the total of all damages resulting from any one accident. However, without changing this total limit of liability, we will comply with any law that requires us to provide any separate limits.     The limits of liability under this Part III will be reduced by all sums: 1. paid because of bodily injury by or on behalf of any persons or organiza-     tions that may be legally responsible; 2. paid under Part I\\u2014Liability To Others; and 3. paid or payable because of bodily injury under any of the following or simi-     lar laws: a. workers\\u2019 compensation law; or b. disability benefits law.     We will not pay under this Part III any expenses paid or payable under Part II\\u2014 Medical Payments Coverage.     No one will be entitled to duplicate payments for the same elements of damages.14     If multiple auto policies issued by us are in effect for you, we will pay no more than the highest limit of liability for this coverage available under any one policy.     OTHER INSURANCE     If an insured person sustains bodily injury while occupying a motor vehicle, and there is other applicable uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, we will pay only our share of the damages . Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all available coverage limits . However, any insurance we provide with respect to a vehicle that is not a covered auto will be excess over any other uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage.     The coverage provided under this policy for an insured person who sustains bodily injury while not occupying a motor vehicle shall be excess to any unin- sured motorist coverage or underinsured motorist coverage provided by a policy under which that insured person is a named insured. If you are injured while not occupying a motor vehicle and are also a named insured under any other policy, our coverage will pay the proportionate share that our limits bear to the total available uninsured motorist coverage or underinsured motorist coverage limits.     ARBITRATION     If we and an insured person cannot agree on: 1. the legal liability of the operator or owner of an uninsured motor vehicle or     underinsured motor vehicle; or 2. the amount of the damages sustained by the insured person; this will be determined by arbitration if we and the insured person mutually agree to arbitration prior to the expiration of the bodily injury statute of limitations in the state in which the accident occurred.     In the event of arbitration, each party will select an arbitrator . The two arbitrators will select a third. If the two arbitrators cannot agree on a third arbitrator within 30 days, then on joint application by the insured person and us, the third arbitrator will be appointed by a court having jurisdiction.\\\\n\\\\nMetadata: {'x-amz-bedrock-kb-source-uri': 's3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-document-page-number': 16.0, 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-chunk-id': '1%3A0%3ACeCPhJoB8T_-1QJqBSkU', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-data-source-id': '8L7KL1MIT4'}\\\\n\\\\nScore: 0.4378\\\\nDocument ID: s3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf\\\\nContent: \\u201cUnderinsured motor vehicle\\u201d means a land motor vehicle or trailer of any type to which a bodily injury liability bond or policy applies at the time of the accident, but the sum of the limits of liability for bodily injury under all ap- plicable policies or bonds: a. is less than the coverage limit for Underinsured Motorist Coverage     shown on the declarations page of this policy; or b. has been reduced by payments for bodily injury to persons injured in     the accident, other than an insured person, to less than the coverage limit for Underinsured Motorist Coverage shown on the declarations page of this policy .

In determining the amount necessary to repair damaged property to its pre-loss condition, the amount to be paid by us: (i) will not exceed the prevailing competitive labor rates charged in the     area where the property is to be repaired and the cost of repair or replacement parts and equipment, as reasonably determined by us; and     (ii) will be based on the cost of repair or replacement parts and equip- ment which may be new, reconditioned, remanufactured or used, including, but not limited to: (a) original manufacturer parts or equipment; and (b) nonoriginal manufacturer parts or equipment.     e.

Un- repaired prior damage includes broken, cracked or missing parts; rust; dents; scrapes; gouges; and peeling paint. The reduction for unrepaired prior damage is the cost of labor, parts and materials necessary to repair or replace damage, deterioration, defects, or wear and tear on exterior body parts, windshields and other glass, wheels, and paint, that existed prior to the accident and that is eliminated as a result of the repair or replacement of property damaged in the loss.21     f.

No deductible will apply to a loss to window glass when the glass is repaired instead of replaced.     4. Duplicate recovery for the same elements of damages is not permitted. 5. The following additional limits of liability apply to Pet Injury coverage:     a. The most we will pay for all damages in any one loss is a total of $1,000 regardless of the number of dogs or cats involved.     b. If your pet dies in, or as a direct result of, a covered loss, we will provide a death benefit of $1,000, less any payment we made toward veterinary expenses for your pet.     c. No deductible shall apply to this coverage.     PAYMENT OF LOSS     We may, at our option: 1. pay for the loss in money; or 2. repair or replace the damaged or stolen property.

This coverage is limited to the each day limit shown on the declarations page for a maximum of 30 days.     If Rental Reimbursement Coverage applies, no other coverage under this policy for rental expenses will apply.     Rental charges will be reimbursed beginning: 1. when the covered auto cannot be driven due to a loss; or 2. if the covered auto can be driven, when you deliver the covered auto to an     auto repair shop or one of our Service Centers for repairs due to the loss; and ending the earliest of: 1. when the covered auto has been returned to you; 2. when the covered auto has been repaired; 3. when the covered auto has been replaced;17     4. 72 hours after we make an offer to settle the loss if the covered auto is deemed by us to be a total loss; or     5. when you incur 30 days worth of rental charges.

If multiple auto policies issued by us are in effect for you, we will pay no more than the highest limit of liability for this coverage available under any one policy.     An auto and attached trailer are considered one auto . Therefore, the limits of li- ability will not be increased for an accident involving an auto that has an attached trailer.     FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LAWS     When we certify this policy as proof of financial responsibility, this policy will com- ply with the law to the extent required. The insured person must reimburse us if we make a payment that we would not have made if this policy was not certified as proof of financial responsibility.     OTHER INSURANCE     If there is any other applicable liability insurance or bond, we will pay only our share of the damages . Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits . However, any insurance we provide for a ve- hicle or trailer, other than a covered auto, will be excess over any other collect- ible insurance, self-insurance, or bond.7     OUT-OF-STATE COVERAGE     If an accident to which this Part I applies occurs in any state, territory or pos- session of the United States of America or any province or territory of Canada, other than the one in which a covered auto is principally garaged, and the state, province, territory or possession has: 1. a financial responsibility or similar law requiring limits of liability for bodily in-     jury or property damage higher than the limits shown on the declarations page, this policy will provide the higher limits; or     2. a compulsory insurance or similar law requiring a non-resident to maintain insurance whenever the non-resident uses an auto in that state, province, territory or possession, this policy will provide the greater of: a. the required minimum amounts and types of coverage; or b. the limits of liability under this policy.     PART II\\u2014MEDICAL PAYMENTS COVERAGE     INSURING AGREEMENT     If you pay the premium for this coverage, we will pay the reasonable expenses incurred for necessary medical services received within three years from the date of a motor vehicle accident because of bodily injury: 1. sustained by an insured person; and 2. caused by that motor vehicle accident.     We, or someone on our behalf, will determine: 1. whether the expenses for medical services are reasonable; and 2. whether the medical services are necessary.     ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS     When used in this Part II: 1. \\u201cInsured person\\u201d means:     a. you, a relative, or a rated resident: (i) while occupying an auto; or (ii) when struck by a motor vehicle or a trailer while not occupying a     self-propelled motorized vehicle; and b. any other person while occupying a covered auto with the permission     of you, a relative, or a rated resident. 2. \\u201cMedical services\\u201d means medical, surgical, chiropractic, dental, x-ray, am-     bulance, hospital, professional nursing, and funeral services, and includes the cost of eyeglasses, hearing aids, pharmaceuticals, orthopedics, and prosthetic devices.     3. \\u201cMotor vehicle\\u201d means a land motor vehicle designed for use principally on public roads.8     EXCLUSIONS\\u2014READ THE FOLLOWING EXCLUSIONS CAREFULLY .

This exclusion does not apply to shared-expense car pools;     2. arising out of an accident involving a vehicle while being maintained or used by a person while employed or engaged in any auto business . This exclu- sion does not apply to you, a relative, a rated resident, or an agent or em- ployee of you, a relative, or a rated resident, when using a covered auto;     3. to any person resulting from, or sustained during practice or preparation for: a. any pre-arranged or organized racing, stunting, speed or demolition con-     test or activity; or b. any driving activity conducted on a permanent or temporary racetrack or     racecourse; 4. due to a nuclear reaction or radiation; 5. for which insurance:     a. is afforded under a nuclear energy liability insurance contract; or b. would be afforded under a nuclear energy liability insurance contract but     for its termination upon exhaustion of its limit of liability; 6. for which the United States Government is liable under the Federal Tort     Claims Act; 7. sustained by any person while occupying any vehicle or trailer while located     for use as a residence or premises; 8. if workers\\u2019 compensation benefits are available for the bodily injury; 9. sustained by any person while occupying or when struck by any vehicle     owned by you or furnished or available for your regular use, other than a covered auto for which this coverage has been purchased;     10. sustained by any person while occupying or when struck by any vehicle owned by a relative or a rated resident or furnished or available for the regular use of a relative or a rated resident, other than a covered auto for which this coverage has been purchased.\\\\n\\\\nMetadata: {'x-amz-bedrock-kb-source-uri': 's3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-document-page-number': 10.0, 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-chunk-id': '1%3A0%3ABeCPhJoB8T_-1QJqBSkU', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-data-source-id': '8L7KL1MIT4'}\\\"}]}}]\"\n",

Failure to give us notice within the prescribed time or as soon as reasonably possible does not bar our liability under this policy if you can prove that our rights and interests have not been prejudiced by your failure to give us notice as required.     A person seeking coverage must: 1. cooperate with us in any matter concerning a claim or lawsuit; 2. provide any written proof of loss we may reasonably require; 3. allow us to take signed and recorded statements, including sworn statements     and examinations under oath, which we may conduct outside the presence25     of you or any other person seeking coverage, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may reasonably require;     4. promptly call to notify us about any claim or lawsuit and send us any and all legal papers relating to the claim or suit;     5. attend hearings and trials as we require; 6. take reasonable steps after a loss to protect the covered auto, or any other     vehicle for which coverage is sought, from further loss .

The premium for this policy is based on information we received from you and other sources .

The coverage provided in your policy may be changed only by the issuance of a new policy or an endorsement by us . However, if during the policy period we broaden any coverage afforded under the current edition of your policy without additional premium charge, that change will automatically apply to your policy as of the date the coverage change is implemented in your state.     If you ask us to delete a vehicle from this policy, no coverage will apply to that vehicle as of the date and time you ask us to delete it.     DUTY TO REPORT CHANGES     You must promptly report to us all changes, including additions and deletions, in policy information.

If the trailer is not shown on the declarations page, the limit of liability is $500.     2. Payments for loss to a covered auto, non-owned auto, or custom parts or equipment are subject to the following provisions: a. If coverage applies to a non-owned auto, we will provide the broadest     coverage applicable to any covered auto shown on the declarations page.     b. If you have elected a Stated Amount for a covered auto, the Stated Amount is the most we will pay for all loss to that covered auto, includ- ing its custom parts or equipment.     c. Coverage for custom parts or equipment will not cause our limit of li- ability for loss to an auto under this Part IV to be increased to an amount in excess of the actual cash value of the auto, including its custom parts or equipment.     d. In determining the amount necessary to repair damaged property to its pre-loss condition, the amount to be paid by us: (i) will not exceed the prevailing competitive labor rates charged in the     area where the property is to be repaired and the cost of repair or replacement parts and equipment, as reasonably determined by us; and     (ii) will be based on the cost of repair or replacement parts and equip- ment which may be new, reconditioned, remanufactured or used, including, but not limited to: (a) original manufacturer parts or equipment; and (b) nonoriginal manufacturer parts or equipment.     e. To determine the amount necessary to repair or replace the damaged property as referred to in subsection 1., the total cost of necessary re- pair or replacement may be reduced by unrepaired prior damage . Un- repaired prior damage includes broken, cracked or missing parts; rust; dents; scrapes; gouges; and peeling paint. The reduction for unrepaired prior damage is the cost of labor, parts and materials necessary to repair or replace damage, deterioration, defects, or wear and tear on exterior body parts, windshields and other glass, wheels, and paint, that existed prior to the accident and that is eliminated as a result of the repair or replacement of property damaged in the loss.21     f. To determine the amount necessary to repair or replace the damaged property as referred to in subsection 1., an adjustment may be made for betterment or depreciation and physical condition on: (i) batteries; (ii) tires; (iii) engines and transmissions, if the engine has greater than 80,000     miles; and (iv) any other mechanical parts that are nonfunctioning or inoperative . We will not make an adjustment for the labor costs associated with the replacement or repair of these parts.     g. The actual cash value is determined by the market value, age, and con- dition of the vehicle at the time the loss occurs.     3. No deductible will apply to a loss to window glass when the glass is repaired instead of replaced.     4. Duplicate recovery for the same elements of damages is not permitted. 5. The following additional limits of liability apply to Pet Injury coverage:     a. The most we will pay for all damages in any one loss is a total of $1,000 regardless of the number of dogs or cats involved.     b. If your pet dies in, or as a direct result of, a covered loss, we will provide a death benefit of $1,000, less any payment we made toward veterinary expenses for your pet.     c. No deductible shall apply to this coverage.     PAYMENT OF LOSS     We may, at our option: 1. pay for the loss in money; or 2. repair or replace the damaged or stolen property.     At our expense, we may return any recovered stolen property to you or to the address shown on the declarations page, with payment for any damage result- ing from the theft. We may keep all or part of the property at the agreed or ap- praised value.     We may settle any loss with you or the owner or lienholder of the property.     NO BENEFIT TO BAILEE     Coverage under this Part IV will not directly or indirectly benefit any carrier or other bailee for hire.     LOSS PAYABLE CLAUSE     Payment under this Part IV for a loss to a covered auto will be made according to your interest and the interest of any lienholder shown on the declarations page or designated by you . At our option, payment may be made to both jointly,22     or to either separately . However, if the covered auto is not a total loss, we may make payment to you and the repairer of the auto.     The lienholder\\u2019s interest will not be protected: 1. where fraud, misrepresentation, material omission, or intentional damage     resulting in a denial of coverage by us has been committed by or at the direc- tion of you or any person seeking coverage; or     2. where the loss is otherwise not covered under the terms of this policy . If this policy is cancelled, nonrenewed or voided, the interest of any lienholder under this agreement will also terminate.     OTHER SOURCES OF RECOVERY     If other sources of recovery also cover the loss, we will pay only our share of the loss . Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits . However, any insurance we provide for a non-owned auto, or trailer not shown on the declarations page, will be excess over any other col- lectible source of recovery including, but not limited to: 1. any coverage provided by the owner of the non-owned auto or trailer; 2. any other applicable physical damage insurance; and 3. any other source of recovery applicable to the loss.\\\\n\\\\nMetadata: {'x-amz-bedrock-kb-source-uri': 's3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-document-page-number': 24.0, 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-chunk-id': '1%3A0%3ADeCPhJoB8T_-1QJqBSkV', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-data-source-id': '8L7KL1MIT4'}\\\\n\\\\nScore: 0.4309\\\\nDocument ID: s3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf\\\\nContent: INSURING AGREEMENT\\u2014RENTAL REIMBURSEMENT COVERAGE     We will reimburse rental charges incurred when you rent an auto from a rental agency or auto repair shop due to a loss to a covered auto for which Rental Re- imbursement Coverage has been purchased.

This coverage is limited to the each day limit shown on the declarations page for a maximum of 30 days.

INSURING AGREEMENT\\u2014LOAN/LEASE PAYOFF COVERAGE     If you pay the premium for this coverage, and the covered auto for which this coverage was purchased is deemed by us to be a total loss, we will pay, in addi- tion to any amounts otherwise payable under this Part IV, the difference between: 1. the actual cash value of the covered auto at the time of the total loss; and 2. any greater amount the owner of the covered auto is legally obligated to     pay under a written loan or lease agreement to which the covered auto is subject at the time of the total loss, reduced by: a. unpaid finance charges or refunds due to the owner for such charges; b. excess mileage charges or charges for wear and tear; c. charges for extended warranties or refunds due to the owner for extend-     ed warranties; d. charges for credit insurance or refunds due to the owner for credit insur-     ance; e. past due payments and charges for past due payments; and f. collection or repossession expenses.     However, our payment under this coverage shall not exceed the limit of liability shown on the declarations page . The limit of liability is a percentage of the ac- tual cash value of the covered auto at the time of the loss.     This coverage applies only if you have purchased both Comprehensive Cover- age and Collision Coverage for that covered auto and the loss is covered under one of those coverages.     INSURING AGREEMENT\\u2014PET INJURY COVERAGE     If you have purchased Collision coverage for at least one covered auto under your policy, and if your pet sustains injury or death while inside a covered auto or non-owned auto at the time of a loss covered under Collision or Comprehen- sive coverage, we will provide: 1. up to $1,000 for reasonable and customary veterinary fees incurred by you,     a relative, or a rated resident if your pet is injured in, or as a direct result of, the covered loss; or     2. a $1,000 death benefit if your pet dies in, or as a direct result of, the covered loss, less any payment we made toward veterinary expenses for your pet .     In the event of a covered loss due to the theft of a covered auto or non-owned auto, we will provide the death benefit provided your pet is inside that auto at the time of the theft and your pet is not recovered.18     ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS     When used in this Part IV: 1. \\u201cCollision\\u201d means the upset of a vehicle or its impact with another vehicle or     object. 2. \\u201cCustom parts or equipment\\u201d means equipment, devices, accessories,     enhancements and changes, other than those that are offered by the manu- facturer specifically for that auto model, or that are installed by the auto dealership as part of the original sale of a new auto, that: a. are permanently installed or attached; and b. alter the appearance or performance of the auto.     3. \\u201cMechanical parts\\u201d means operational parts on a vehicle that wear out over time or have a finite useful life or duration typically shorter than the life of the vehicle as a whole .

FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LAWS     When we certify this policy as proof of financial responsibility, this policy will com- ply with the law to the extent required. The insured person must reimburse us if we make a payment that we would not have made if this policy was not certified as proof of financial responsibility.     OTHER INSURANCE     If there is any other applicable liability insurance or bond, we will pay only our share of the damages .

However, if there is no other valid and col- lectible insurance with limits equal to or greater than the minimum limits of liability coverage required by the financial responsibility law of the State of Wisconsin, this exclusion shall apply only to the extent the damages exceed the minimum liability limits required.

LIMITS OF LIABILITY     The limit of liability shown on the declarations page for liability coverage is the most we will pay regardless of the number of: 1. claims made; 2. covered autos; 3. insured persons; 4. lawsuits brought; 5. vehicles involved in the accident; or 6. premiums paid.     If your declarations page shows a split limit: 1. the amount shown for “each person” is the most we will pay for all damages     due to bodily injury to one person resulting from any one accident; 2. subject to the “each person” limit, the amount shown for “each accident” is     the most we will pay for all damages due to bodily injury sustained by two or more persons in any one accident; and6     3. the amount shown for “property damage” is the most we will pay for the total of all property damage resulting from any one accident.     The “each person” limit of liability applies to the total of all claims made for bodily injury to a person and all claims of others derived from such bodily injury, in- cluding, but not limited to, emotional injury or mental anguish resulting from the bodily injury of another or from witnessing the bodily injury to another, loss of society, loss of companionship, loss of services, loss of consortium, and wrong- ful death.     If the declarations page shows that “combined single limit” or “CSL” applies, the amount shown is the most we will pay for the total of all damages resulting from any one accident. However, without changing this limit of liability, we will comply with any law that requires us to provide any separate limits.     No one is entitled to duplicate payments for the same elements of damages.     Any payment to a person under this Part I will be reduced by any payment to that person under Part III—Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage.     We will not pay under this Part I any expenses paid or payable under Part II— Medical Payments Coverage.     If multiple auto policies issued by us are in effect for you, we will pay no more than the highest limit of liability for this coverage available under any one policy.     An auto and attached trailer are considered one auto . Therefore, the limits of li- ability will not be increased for an accident involving an auto that has an attached trailer.\\n\\nMetadata: {'x-amz-bedrock-kb-source-uri': 's3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-document-page-number': 8.0, 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-chunk-id': '1%3A0%3ABOCPhJoB8T_-1QJqBSkT', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-data-source-id': '8L7KL1MIT4'}\\n\\nScore: 0.4434\\nDocument ID: s3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf\\nContent: This exclusion does not apply to shared-expense car pools; or     b. a motor vehicle that is owned by or available for the regular use of you, a relative, or a rated resident .This exclusion does not apply to a covered auto that is insured under this Part III;     2. to bodily injury sustained by you, a relative, or a rated resident while us- ing any vehicle, other than a covered auto, without the permission of the owner of the vehicle or the person in lawful possession of the vehicle;     3. directly or indirectly to benefit any insurer or self-insurer under any of the fol- lowing or similar laws: a. workers’ compensation law; or b. disability benefits law;     4. to any punitive or exemplary damages; 5. to bodily injury sustained by any person if that person or the legal represen-     tative of that person settles without our written consent; 6. to bodily injury sustained by any person caused by an accident with an     uninsured motor vehicle that is owned by, furnished to, or available for the regular use of you, a relative, or a rated resident; or     7. to bodily injury arising out of the use of any vehicle while being used in con- nection with a personal vehicle sharing program.     LIMITS OF LIABILITY     The limit of liability shown on the declarations page for Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage is the most we will pay regardless of the number of: 1. claims made; 2. covered autos;13     3. insured persons; 4. lawsuits brought; 5. vehicles involved in the accident; 6. premiums paid; 7. premiums shown on the declarations page; or 8. policies involved.     The maximum amount of uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage available for bodily injury or death suffered by an insured person while not occupying a motor vehicle at the time of an accident is the highest single limit of uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, whichever is applicable, for any motor vehicle with respect to which the person is insured.     If your declarations page shows a split limit: 1. the amount shown for “each person” is the most we will pay for all damages     due to bodily injury to one person; and 2. subject to the “each person” limit, the amount shown for “each accident” is     the most we will pay for all damages due to bodily injury sustained by two or more persons in any one accident.     The “each person” limit of liability includes the total of all claims made for bodily injury to an insured person and all claims of others derived from such bodily injury, including, but not limited to, emotional injury or mental anguish resulting from the bodily injury of another or from witnessing the bodily injury to an- other, loss of society, loss of companionship, loss of services, loss of consortium, and wrongful death.     If the declarations page shows that “combined single limit” or “CSL” applies, the amount shown is the most we will pay for the total of all damages resulting from any one accident. However, without changing this total limit of liability, we will comply with any law that requires us to provide any separate limits.     The limits of liability under this Part III will be reduced by all sums: 1. paid because of bodily injury by or on behalf of any persons or organiza-     tions that may be legally responsible; 2. paid under Part I—Liability To Others; and 3. paid or payable because of bodily injury under any of the following or simi-     lar laws: a. workers’ compensation law; or b. disability benefits law.     We will not pay under this Part III any expenses paid or payable under Part II— Medical Payments Coverage.     No one will be entitled to duplicate payments for the same elements of damages.14     If multiple auto policies issued by us are in effect for you, we will pay no more than the highest limit of liability for this coverage available under any one policy.     OTHER INSURANCE     If an insured person sustains bodily injury while occupying a motor vehicle, and there is other applicable uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, we will pay only our share of the damages . Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all available coverage limits . However, any insurance we provide with respect to a vehicle that is not a covered auto will be excess over any other uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage.     The coverage provided under this policy for an insured person who sustains bodily injury while not occupying a motor vehicle shall be excess to any unin- sured motorist coverage or underinsured motorist coverage provided by a policy under which that insured person is a named insured. If you are injured while not occupying a motor vehicle and are also a named insured under any other policy, our coverage will pay the proportionate share that our limits bear to the total available uninsured motorist coverage or underinsured motorist coverage limits.     ARBITRATION     If we and an insured person cannot agree on: 1. the legal liability of the operator or owner of an uninsured motor vehicle or     underinsured motor vehicle; or 2. the amount of the damages sustained by the insured person; this will be determined by arbitration if we and the insured person mutually agree to arbitration prior to the expiration of the bodily injury statute of limitations in the state in which the accident occurred.     In the event of arbitration, each party will select an arbitrator . The two arbitrators will select a third. If the two arbitrators cannot agree on a third arbitrator within 30 days, then on joint application by the insured person and us, the third arbitrator will be appointed by a court having jurisdiction.\\n\\nMetadata: {'x-amz-bedrock-kb-source-uri': 's3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-document-page-number': 16.0, 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-chunk-id': '1%3A0%3ACeCPhJoB8T_-1QJqBSkU', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-data-source-id': '8L7KL1MIT4'}\\n\\nScore: 0.4378\\nDocument ID: s3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf\\nContent: “Underinsured motor vehicle” means a land motor vehicle or trailer of any type to which a bodily injury liability bond or policy applies at the time of the accident, but the sum of the limits of liability for bodily injury under all ap- plicable policies or bonds: a. is less than the coverage limit for Underinsured Motorist Coverage     shown on the declarations page of this policy; or b. has been reduced by payments for bodily injury to persons injured in     the accident, other than an insured person, to less than the coverage limit for Underinsured Motorist Coverage shown on the declarations page of this policy .

If you have elected a Stated Amount for a covered auto, the Stated Amount is the most we will pay for all loss to that covered auto, includ- ing its custom parts or equipment.     c. Coverage for custom parts or equipment will not cause our limit of li- ability for loss to an auto under this Part IV to be increased to an amount in excess of the actual cash value of the auto, including its custom parts or equipment.     d. In determining the amount necessary to repair damaged property to its pre-loss condition, the amount to be paid by us: (i) will not exceed the prevailing competitive labor rates charged in the     area where the property is to be repaired and the cost of repair or replacement parts and equipment, as reasonably determined by us; and     (ii) will be based on the cost of repair or replacement parts and equip- ment which may be new, reconditioned, remanufactured or used, including, but not limited to: (a) original manufacturer parts or equipment; and (b) nonoriginal manufacturer parts or equipment.     e. To determine the amount necessary to repair or replace the damaged property as referred to in subsection 1., the total cost of necessary re- pair or replacement may be reduced by unrepaired prior damage . Un- repaired prior damage includes broken, cracked or missing parts; rust; dents; scrapes; gouges; and peeling paint. The reduction for unrepaired prior damage is the cost of labor, parts and materials necessary to repair or replace damage, deterioration, defects, or wear and tear on exterior body parts, windshields and other glass, wheels, and paint, that existed prior to the accident and that is eliminated as a result of the repair or replacement of property damaged in the loss.21     f.

We will not make an adjustment for the labor costs associated with the replacement or repair of these parts.     g. The actual cash value is determined by the market value, age, and con- dition of the vehicle at the time the loss occurs.     3. No deductible will apply to a loss to window glass when the glass is repaired instead of replaced.     4. Duplicate recovery for the same elements of damages is not permitted. 5.

If your pet dies in, or as a direct result of, a covered loss, we will provide a death benefit of $1,000, less any payment we made toward veterinary expenses for your pet.     c. No deductible shall apply to this coverage.     PAYMENT OF LOSS     We may, at our option: 1. pay for the loss in money; or 2. repair or replace the damaged or stolen property.     At our expense, we may return any recovered stolen property to you or to the address shown on the declarations page, with payment for any damage result- ing from the theft. We may keep all or part of the property at the agreed or ap- praised value.     We may settle any loss with you or the owner or lienholder of the property.

In the event of a covered loss due to the theft of a covered auto or non-owned auto, we will provide the death benefit provided your pet is inside that auto at the time of the theft and your pet is not recovered.18     ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS     When used in this Part IV: 1. “Collision” means the upset of a vehicle or its impact with another vehicle or     object. 2. “Custom parts or equipment” means equipment, devices, accessories,     enhancements and changes, other than those that are offered by the manu- facturer specifically for that auto model, or that are installed by the auto dealership as part of the original sale of a new auto, that: a. are permanently installed or attached; and b. alter the appearance or performance of the auto.     3. “Mechanical parts” means operational parts on a vehicle that wear out over time or have a finite useful life or duration typically shorter than the life of the vehicle as a whole .

If multiple auto policies issued by us are in effect for you, we will pay no more than the highest limit of liability for this coverage available under any one policy.     An auto and attached trailer are considered one auto . Therefore, the limits of li- ability will not be increased for an accident involving an auto that has an attached trailer.     FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LAWS     When we certify this policy as proof of financial responsibility, this policy will com- ply with the law to the extent required. The insured person must reimburse us if we make a payment that we would not have made if this policy was not certified as proof of financial responsibility.     OTHER INSURANCE     If there is any other applicable liability insurance or bond, we will pay only our share of the damages . Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits . However, any insurance we provide for a ve- hicle or trailer, other than a covered auto, will be excess over any other collect- ible insurance, self-insurance, or bond.7     OUT-OF-STATE COVERAGE     If an accident to which this Part I applies occurs in any state, territory or pos- session of the United States of America or any province or territory of Canada, other than the one in which a covered auto is principally garaged, and the state, province, territory or possession has: 1. a financial responsibility or similar law requiring limits of liability for bodily in-     jury or property damage higher than the limits shown on the declarations page, this policy will provide the higher limits; or     2. a compulsory insurance or similar law requiring a non-resident to maintain insurance whenever the non-resident uses an auto in that state, province, territory or possession, this policy will provide the greater of: a. the required minimum amounts and types of coverage; or b. the limits of liability under this policy.     PART II—MEDICAL PAYMENTS COVERAGE     INSURING AGREEMENT     If you pay the premium for this coverage, we will pay the reasonable expenses incurred for necessary medical services received within three years from the date of a motor vehicle accident because of bodily injury: 1. sustained by an insured person; and 2. caused by that motor vehicle accident.     We, or someone on our behalf, will determine: 1. whether the expenses for medical services are reasonable; and 2. whether the medical services are necessary.     ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS     When used in this Part II: 1. “Insured person” means:     a. you, a relative, or a rated resident: (i) while occupying an auto; or (ii) when struck by a motor vehicle or a trailer while not occupying a     self-propelled motorized vehicle; and b. any other person while occupying a covered auto with the permission     of you, a relative, or a rated resident. 2. “Medical services” means medical, surgical, chiropractic, dental, x-ray, am-     bulance, hospital, professional nursing, and funeral services, and includes the cost of eyeglasses, hearing aids, pharmaceuticals, orthopedics, and prosthetic devices.     3. “Motor vehicle” means a land motor vehicle designed for use principally on public roads.8     EXCLUSIONS—READ THE FOLLOWING EXCLUSIONS CAREFULLY . IF AN EXCLUSION APPLIES, COVERAGE WILL NOT BE AFFORDED UNDER THIS PART II.

This exclusion does not apply to shared-expense car pools;     2. arising out of an accident involving a vehicle while being maintained or used by a person while employed or engaged in any auto business . This exclu- sion does not apply to you, a relative, a rated resident, or an agent or em- ployee of you, a relative, or a rated resident, when using a covered auto;     3. to any person resulting from, or sustained during practice or preparation for: a. any pre-arranged or organized racing, stunting, speed or demolition con-     test or activity; or b. any driving activity conducted on a permanent or temporary racetrack or     racecourse; 4. due to a nuclear reaction or radiation; 5. for which insurance:     a. is afforded under a nuclear energy liability insurance contract; or b. would be afforded under a nuclear energy liability insurance contract but     for its termination upon exhaustion of its limit of liability; 6. for which the United States Government is liable under the Federal Tort     Claims Act; 7. sustained by any person while occupying any vehicle or trailer while located     for use as a residence or premises; 8. if workers’ compensation benefits are available for the bodily injury; 9. sustained by any person while occupying or when struck by any vehicle     owned by you or furnished or available for your regular use, other than a covered auto for which this coverage has been purchased;     10. sustained by any person while occupying or when struck by any vehicle owned by a relative or a rated resident or furnished or available for the regular use of a relative or a rated resident, other than a covered auto for which this coverage has been purchased.\\n\\nMetadata: {'x-amz-bedrock-kb-source-uri': 's3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-document-page-number': 10.0, 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-chunk-id': '1%3A0%3ABeCPhJoB8T_-1QJqBSkU', 'x-amz-bedrock-kb-data-source-id': '8L7KL1MIT4'}\"}], 'toolUseId': 'tooluse_jjXZIh3WiKpouI6xo63bDl', 'status': 'success'}}], 'role': 'user'}, {'content': [{'text': 'Now let me search for information about reporting timeframes and claim filing requirements.'}, {'toolUse': {'input': {'text': 'claim reporting time limit notice accident reporting requirements'}, 'name': 'retrieve', 'toolUseId': 'tooluse_ZJGrxJ3ZG2P1EJ1uT8XPn3'}}], 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': [{'toolResult': {'content': [{'text': \"Retrieved 2 results with score >= 0.4:\\n\\nScore: 0.4577\\nDocument ID: s3://mydata-ealfcast/AutoInsurancePolicy/Policy Contract - 9611 (12_14)-1.pdf\\nContent: Notice of an accident or loss given by you to any agent authorized by us within the State of Wisconsin, with particulars sufficient to identify you as an insured person, is notice to us .

CHANGES     This policy contract, your insurance application (which is made a part of this policy as if attached hereto), the declarations page, and all endorsements to this policy issued by us, contain all the agreements between you and us . Sub- ject to the following, the terms of this policy may not be changed or waived except by an endorsement issued by us.     The premium for this policy is based on information we received from you and other sources . You agree to cooperate with us in determining if this information is correct and complete, and to promptly notify us if it changes during the policy period.

If you ask us to delete a vehicle from this policy, no coverage will apply to that vehicle as of the date and time you ask us to delete it.     DUTY TO REPORT CHANGES     You must promptly report to us all changes, including additions and deletions, in policy information.

Payments for loss to a covered auto, non-owned auto, or custom parts or equipment are subject to the following provisions: a. If coverage applies to a non-owned auto, we will provide the broadest     coverage applicable to any covered auto shown on the declarations page.     b. If you have elected a Stated Amount for a covered auto, the Stated Amount is the most we will pay for all loss to that covered auto, includ- ing its custom parts or equipment.     c. Coverage for custom parts or equipment will not cause our limit of li- ability for loss to an auto under this Part IV to be increased to an amount in excess of the actual cash value of the auto, including its custom parts or equipment.     d. In determining the amount necessary to repair damaged property to its pre-loss condition, the amount to be paid by us: (i) will not exceed the prevailing competitive labor rates charged in the     area where the property is to be repaired and the cost of repair or replacement parts and equipment, as reasonably determined by us; and     (ii) will be based on the cost of repair or replacement parts and equip- ment which may be new, reconditioned, remanufactured or used, including, but not limited to: (a) original manufacturer parts or equipment; and (b) nonoriginal manufacturer parts or equipment.     e. To determine the amount necessary to repair or replace the damaged property as referred to in subsection 1., the total cost of necessary re- pair or replacement may be reduced by unrepaired prior damage . Un- repaired prior damage includes broken, cracked or missing parts; rust; dents; scrapes; gouges; and peeling paint. The reduction for unrepaired prior damage is the cost of labor, parts and materials necessary to repair or replace damage, deterioration, defects, or wear and tear on exterior body parts, windshields and other glass, wheels, and paint, that existed prior to the accident and that is eliminated as a result of the repair or replacement of property damaged in the loss.21     f.

The actual cash value is determined by the market value, age, and con- dition of the vehicle at the time the loss occurs.     3. No deductible will apply to a loss to window glass when the glass is repaired instead of replaced.     4. Duplicate recovery for the same elements of damages is not permitted. 5. The following additional limits of liability apply to Pet Injury coverage:     a. The most we will pay for all damages in any one loss is a total of $1,000 regardless of the number of dogs or cats involved.     b. If your pet dies in, or as a direct result of, a covered loss, we will provide a death benefit of $1,000, less any payment we made toward veterinary expenses for your pet.     c. No deductible shall apply to this coverage.     PAYMENT OF LOSS     We may, at our option: 1. pay for the loss in money; or 2. repair or replace the damaged or stolen property.     At our expense, we may return any recovered stolen property to you or to the address shown on the declarations page, with payment for any damage result- ing from the theft.

The insured person must reimburse us if we make a payment that we would not have made if this policy was not certified as proof of financial responsibility.

Your failure to give any notice required by this policy within the time specified does not invalidate a claim made by you if you can show that it was not reasonably possible to give us notice within the prescribed time and that notice was given as soon as reasonably possible . Failure to give us notice within the prescribed time or as soon as reasonably possible does not bar our liability under this policy if you can prove that our rights and interests have not been prejudiced by your failure to give us notice as required.     A person seeking coverage must: 1. cooperate with us in any matter concerning a claim or lawsuit; 2. provide any written proof of loss we may reasonably require; 3. allow us to take signed and recorded statements, including sworn statements     and examinations under oath, which we may conduct outside the presence25     of you or any other person seeking coverage, and answer all reasonable questions we may ask as often as we may reasonably require;     4. promptly call to notify us about any claim or lawsuit and send us any and all legal papers relating to the claim or suit;     5. attend hearings and trials as we require; 6. take reasonable steps after a loss to protect the covered auto, or any other     vehicle for which coverage is sought, from further loss . We will pay reason- able expenses incurred in providing that protection. If failure to provide such protection results in further loss, any additional damages will not be covered under this policy;     7. allow us to have the damaged covered auto, or any other damaged vehicle for which coverage is sought, inspected and appraised before its repair or disposal;     8. submit to medical examinations at our expense by doctors we select as of- ten as we may reasonably require; and     9. authorize us to obtain medical and other records.     PART VII\\u2014GENERAL PROVISIONS     POLICY PERIOD AND TERRITORY     This policy applies only to accidents and losses occurring during the policy pe- riod shown on the declarations page and that occur within a state, territory or possession of the United States of America, or a province or territory of Canada, or while a covered auto is being transported between their ports.     CHANGES     This policy contract, your insurance application (which is made a part of this policy as if attached hereto), the declarations page, and all endorsements to this policy issued by us, contain all the agreements between you and us . Sub- ject to the following, the terms of this policy may not be changed or waived except by an endorsement issued by us.     The premium for this policy is based on information we received from you and other sources . You agree to cooperate with us in determining if this information is correct and complete, and to promptly notify us if it changes during the policy period. If this information is determined by us to be incorrect, incomplete, or if it changes during the policy period, you agree that we may adjust your policy information and premium accordingly . Changes that may result in a premium ad- justment are contained in our rates and rules . These include, but are not limited to, you, a relative, or a rated resident obtaining a driver\\u2019s license or operator\\u2019s permit, or changes in: 1. the number, type or use classification of covered autos; 2. the persons who regularly operate a covered auto; 3. the persons of legal driving age residing in your household;26     4. the residents in your household; 5. an operator\\u2019s marital status; 6. your mailing address and your residence address; 7. the principal garaging address of any covered auto; 8. coverage, deductibles, or limits of liability; or 9. rating territory or discount eligibility.     The coverage provided in your policy may be changed only by the issuance of a new policy or an endorsement by us . However, if during the policy period we broaden any coverage afforded under the current edition of your policy without additional premium charge, that change will automatically apply to your policy as of the date the coverage change is implemented in your state.     If you ask us to delete a vehicle from this policy, no coverage will apply to that vehicle as of the date and time you ask us to delete it.     DUTY TO REPORT CHANGES     You must promptly report to us all changes, including additions and deletions, in policy information. This includes, but is not limited to, changes in: 1. your mailing address or your residence address; 2. the principal garaging address of any covered auto; 3. the residents in your household; 4. the persons of legal driving age residing in your household; 5. the persons who regularly operate a covered auto; 6. an operator\\u2019s marital status; or 7. the driver\\u2019s license or operator\\u2019s permit status of you, a relative, or a rated     resident.     SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS     We may use estimating, appraisal, or injury evaluation systems to assist us in adjusting claims under this policy and to assist us in determining the amount of damages, expenses, or loss payable under this policy . Such systems may be developed by us or a third party and may include computer software, databases, and specialized technology.     TERMS OF POLICY CONFORMED TO STATUTES     If any provision of this policy fails to conform to the statutes of the state listed on your application as your residence, the provision shall be deemed amended to conform to such statutes .

Business Use Exclusion:**\\\\nThe policy also excludes coverage for accidents \\\\\\\"involving any vehicle while being maintained or used by a person while employed or engaged in any auto business.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n**3. Late Reporting Concern:**\\\\nWhile the policy does allow for late claim reporting under certain circumstances, you mentioned this accident occurred \\\\\\\"over 3 months ago.\\\\\\\" The policy requires prompt reporting of accidents, and while there are provisions for late reporting, they require that:\\\\n- It was not reasonably possible to give notice within the prescribed time\\\\n- Notice was given as soon as reasonably possible  \\\\n- The insurer's rights and interests have not been prejudiced\\\\n\\\\n### **Recommendation:**\\\\nSince you were using your personal vehicle for commercial delivery purposes at the time of the accident, your personal auto policy does not provide coverage for this incident.
