    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates an AI-powered automobile repair cost estimation system. The system processes First Notice of Loss (FNOL) data to automatically generate detailed repair cost estimates for collision-damaged vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extracts vehicle information from FNOL JSON documents\n",
    "- Classifies vehicles into standard categories (Car, Truck, SUV, Van)\n",
    "- Calculates repair costs based on industry-standard pricing tiers\n",
    "- Applies cost multipliers for luxury brands and vehicle age\n",
    "- Generates comprehensive JSON repair estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FNOL Data Loading** - Load and parse First Notice of Loss JSON file\n",
    "2. **Vehicle Classification** - Determine vehicle type for appropriate pricing tier\n",
    "3. **Damage Assessment** - Identify all damaged components from FNOL data\n",
    "4. **Cost Calculation** - Apply pricing matrix and multipliers to estimate repair costs\n",
    "5. **Report Generation** - Create structured JSON estimate with detailed breakdown\n",
    "6. **Agent Execution** - Strands agent autonomously invokes estimation tool and provides summary\n",

      "**Favorable Cost Factors:**\n",
      "- Honda Accord is a mainstream vehicle with readily available parts\n",
      "- 2020 model year ensures parts availability and standardized repair procedures\n",
      "- Moderate mileage (35,650) indicates well-maintained vehicle condition\n",
      "\n",
      "**Potential Cost Concerns:**\n",
      "- **Frame damage assessment pending**: The \"possible frame damage\" mentioned requires thorough inspection\n",
      "- **Impact severity**: 5-foot forward movement suggests significant force\n",
      "- **Trunk misalignment**: May indicate structural damage beyond surface panels\n",

      "### **4. Professional Summary and Recommendations**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Immediate Actions Required:**\n",
      "1. **Comprehensive structural inspection** - The trunk misalignment and mention of possible frame damage warrant a detailed frame assessment using laser measuring equipment\n",
      "2. **Supplement estimate likely** - Initial estimate may increase once vehicle is disassembled and hidden damage is revealed\n",
      "3. **Safety inspection** - Ensure all safety systems (airbags, seat belt pretensioners) function properly after impact\n",
      "\n",
      "**Estimate Reliability:**\n",

      "- **Frame damage potential**: Could add $2,000-$5,000+ if structural repair needed\n",
      "\n",
      "**Next Steps:**\n",
      "1. Authorize teardown inspection at approved repair facility\n",
      "2. Request detailed frame measurements and alignment check\n",
