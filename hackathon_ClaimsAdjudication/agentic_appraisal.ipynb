    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates an AI-powered automobile repair cost estimation system. The system processes First Notice of Loss (FNOL) data to automatically generate detailed repair cost estimates for collision-damaged vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extracts vehicle information from FNOL JSON documents\n",
    "- Classifies vehicles into standard categories (Car, Truck, SUV, Van)\n",
    "- Calculates repair costs based on industry-standard pricing tiers\n",
    "- Applies cost multipliers for luxury brands and vehicle age\n",
    "- Generates comprehensive JSON repair estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FNOL Data Loading** - Load and parse First Notice of Loss JSON file\n",
    "2. **Vehicle Classification** - Determine vehicle type for appropriate pricing tier\n",
    "3. **Damage Assessment** - Identify all damaged components from FNOL data\n",
    "4. **Cost Calculation** - Apply pricing matrix and multipliers to estimate repair costs\n",
    "5. **Report Generation** - Create structured JSON estimate with detailed breakdown\n",
    "6. **Agent Execution** - Strands agent autonomously invokes estimation tool and provides summary\n",
