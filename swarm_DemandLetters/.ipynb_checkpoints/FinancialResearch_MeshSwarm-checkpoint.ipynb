    "An agent swarm is a collection of autonomous AI agents working together to solve complex problems through collaboration. Inspired by natural systems like ant colonies or bird flocks, agent swarms leverage collective intelligence where the combined output exceeds what any single agent could produce. By distributing tasks and sharing information, swarms can tackle complex problems more efficiently and effectively than individual agents working in isolation.\n",

    "- *Distributed Problem Solving*: Breaking complex tasks into subtasks for parallel processing\n",
    "- *Information Sharing*: Agents exchange insights to build collective knowledge\n",
    "- *Specialization*: Different agents focus on specific aspects of a problem\n",
    "- *Redundancy*: Multiple agents working on similar tasks improve reliability\n",
    "- *Emergent Intelligence*: The system exhibits capabilities beyond those of its individual components\n",

    "1. *Decentralized Control*: No single agent directs the entire system\n",
    "2. *Local Interactions*: Agents primarily interact with nearby agents\n",

    "Multi-agent swarms solve complex problems through collective intelligence. The Strands Agents SDK supports both custom implementations and a built-in swarm tool with shared memory. By distributing tasks across specialized agents and enabling effective communication, swarms achieve better results than single agents working alone. Whether using mesh communication patterns or the swarm tool, developers can create systems where multiple agents work together with defined roles, coordination mechanisms, and knowledge sharing.\n",
